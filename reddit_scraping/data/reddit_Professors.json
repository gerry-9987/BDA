        "body": "  \n\n**Top 10 Tips**\n\n1.) Set the vision upfront and be collaborative in building it. Allow your colleagues to do what they do best so that they feel a sense of ownership and as a contributor to that vision.\n\n2.) Curriculum- Set the vision for the big picture of what the curricular grid is and allow faculty to help develop the courses to support it. Be collaborative in the process and provide opportunities for faculty to share projects or highlights from their class. This allows everyone to see the competencies being built and the progression of the student.\n\n3.) Build community- Host departmental events with the students.(ie: Have a holiday pot luck, pizza night, guest speakers, game night, do something within the department so that faculty and students build a sense of community)\n\n4.) Communicate often. Share departmental news, wins and challenges to overcome. Each semester I put together a PPT of what was accomplished, what new resources we have, budget updates, students in the news, alumni updates, career tracking, etc\u2026 (I log all of this. It\u2019s a lot of work \u2013 but as the face of the program, you often need answers to share and sell the program.)\n\n5.) Advocate for the department. Work towards getting the resources your faculty and students need to be successful. The battle for resources can be tiring but if your department is producing measurable results (I know, this is a dirty word in higher ed) and you can explain why you need something, its easier to convince admin.)\n\n6.) Work on external relationships. Build opportunities with the community, local organizations, employers, finding grants, etc\u2026 Building experiential learning experiences for your students help them develop soft skills but also brings attention to the program.\n\n7.) Document and highlight student, faculty and staff success stories. This builds a sense of identity for the program and a sense of pride. Hang flyers, posters and plaques. Have a work study student assist with this.\n\n8.) Be collaborative, transparent and fair. Be collaborative not only with your faculty, but other departments and administration. Be honest about decisions and provide solutions so that you can build trust. Be fair in all aspects of support, hiring and decision-making. Approach the Chair position as a service-based leader position.\n\n9.) Set boundaries and delegate when you can. The Chair role can be all consuming on top of teaching and research. (I failed in this aspect.)\n\n10.) Know when its time to pass the torch.\n\n**The hardest part of being a Chair**\n\n1.) Having access to more information than your colleagues that you can\u2019t always share. This can be draining, especially when you speak up about things and question decisions. At some point, a Chair will witness some form of retaliation, discrimination, cat\u2019s paw, untruthfulness and conflicts of interest at the Dean, HR, VP or President level. This will weigh heavily on you.\n\n2.) Reviewing complaints that seem to be an emotional response to something that triggered them during a stressful time. (ie: midterms, finals, feeling upset with their own limitations or effort, grades, etc\u2026) This creates an awkward situation especially if an investigation shows a complaint was embellished.\n\n3.) Sacrificing your research and teaching to keep up with administrative duties\n\n4.) Compensation. There is no reward for being a Chair. Depending on your university, some do not get stipends or even course releases. The Chair duties is often a year-round service operating at a financial loss.\n\n5.) Not being able to provide resources you know the faculty and students need.\n\n6.) Losing faculty. I\u2019ve lost great adjuncts over the years simply because the school wouldn\u2019t pay them enough. This is hard especially when you\u2019ve spent significant time training, scouting and recruiting them.\n\n7.) Lack of leadership and communication of goals from above\n\n8.) Keeping up with communications. Every internal office and external communication regarding the program is directed to the Chair.\n\n9.) Resolving scheduling and space conflicts.\n\n10.) Challenging the Tower. I\u2019m a firm believer that the students deserve an education from experts in their field and those in academia. I don\u2019t care what someone\u2019s degree or certificate is. I\u2019ve dropped ropes from the windows and opened the doors to the tower to bring in community experts, industry professionals and academics to help teach and develop students. This can be an uphill battle in higher ed when there is a belief that only those who have traveled a specific path and has the club house handshake to enter are qualified to teach. \n\nInclusiveness sounds good on marketing materials. It doesn\u2019t mean universities always embrace it.",

I don't like to record classes as it encourages students to miss class, and they almost never watch the videos.   \n\n\nHowever, this is a discussion section. The recording would contain students discussing the content and would be primarily focused on them. I think this is problematic as it opens students to scrutiny over their lack of experience with the material (we learn by discussing, of course they will say things that are \"wrong\" or uninformed.) It also would make for a boring watch and i'm not sure what students who missed the class would get out of it.   \n\n\nAlso, I want students to come to class.   \n\n\nIs anyone else having experience with this?",

        "body": "I utterly hate writing exams and am looking for a better way of organizing my previous exam questions.  I'd appreciate any insight into improving my particular set-up (below), as well as hearing about any other methods people use to track or organize exam questions!\n\nI teach general chemistry, so many of my exam questions are fairly easy to modify for periodic re-use (change which variable we solve for, change the reaction type, change the numbers, etc).  To avoid reinventing the wheel each year, I've kept a Word document, organized by learning objective, where I track the different questions I've asked over time.  Each question has a note about which semester(s) it has been used (and which exam within that semester); rubrics/grading comments; and, for calculation questions, an embedded Excel sheet with formulas to calculate both iterations on correct answers as well as common incorrect answers.  The Excel sheet also allows me to easily change values and equations from semester to semester, to avoid direct re-use.  \n\nWord is.... OK... for this; it gets me by, but it is also very clunky, especially with so much use of the equation editor and embedded spreadsheets.  I feel like a spreadsheet or database would be much more effective, but that would require learning new software.  Does anyone have a better system?  I'm open to learning Microsoft Access or even SQL (I have limited experience with coding), but not sure it would be sufficiently better than the status quo to be worth spending the time to learn a new program.  I know that question databases exist from textbook publishers, but those don't seem to have the fine control I'm looking for to include updatable calculations, semester tracking, etc.  \n\nThe main features I \"have to have\" are: sort/organize/tag by learning objective, semester used, and exam used; be able to look/scroll through the different questions for each objective; be able to contain or link to LaTeX chemical equations/formulae (I use gradescope to scan and grade exams, and their rubrics allow LaTeX); and be able to contain or link to updatable calculations in an excel-type interface.  \n\nMany thanks for any thoughts people share!",

He overshares in class, but not in a way that totally changes the subject. I\u2019ve seen his classmates laugh at him (surreptitiously they think) and it breaks my heart. Last week, he was having such a hard time that I actually had to report him for concerns of self harm. But before I saw his distress, I put the class in groups to work on a synthesis assignment. His group was so patient and welcoming to him, asking him for his input in a sensitive and reassuring way. I\u2019ve seen students close their classmate out if they deem that classmate isn\u2019t doing anything productive, but these two students were so kind to him. He ended up leaving class because of his distress and that\u2019s when I had to file the report. His group mates, meanwhile, said they\u2019d keep him in the loop with the work and to email them if he had anything to add or any questions. \n\nAfter filling out the report and calling public safety to check on him, I thanked the students for being so kind. They have my respect not only as my students but as genuinely good people now. \n\nTl;dr: we have a lot of challenges, but some students make it so worth it.",

        "body": "I find that it\u2019s woefully difficult to actually teach students these days. For the most part they are incredibly lazy and hard to motivate. \n\nYet, they are very intentional about the work they will do. For instance, if you have a hard assignment for them and request a deliverable, most will brainlessly cobble it together (albeit a bit shoddily) and submit it by the due date. This isnt learning, however. It\u2019s just operant conditioning with stimulus response, closer to Pavlov\u2019s dogs. Same with tests pretty much. \n\nI find that when it comes to actual thinking exercises such as in class exercises, students are very difficult to motivate. Most won\u2019t do the readings to prepare for class discussions and will halfass it believing they can BS their way through it or any questions like they do with everything else. And this is if they even bother to show up. I\u2019ve historically had participation at about 15% of the grade, but this doesnt seem sufficient to actually motivate students to study the material and take the in class discussion seriously. \n\nAnyway, I am curious, what are your strategies to captivate and motivate students? How do you structure your class and what kind of in class activities do you like in terms of format? \n\nWould love to hear.",

        "title": "Another needy student walkout when confronted with boundaries - Long rant",
        "body": "HOW did some of these students get to the point of feeling so entitled? The day after I had to have a student come to my office to discuss his behavior after he walked out in the middle of my class, because I was trying to re-establish boundaries, I had a different student in another class do the same thing after she aggressively talked back to me when I tried to set boundaries in class. The first student has been great since our talk, but I don't expect the same outcome with the second student.\n\nContext: I teach an art class that is dependent on technology and is very technically challenging. It's a 2.5hr course once a week. Last week my student was incredibly difficult. Every class she freaks out during a demo, I have to stop and then walk her through it multiple times before I'm \"allowed\" to continue. I usually repeat demos at least 5 times in this one class. She isn't the only one that freaks out and I have to slow down for it, I expect that to a certain extent because it is difficult material and a difficult computer program to learn. When everyone is working, she monopolizes my time and I would bounce between her and 2 other students who were also loud and needy in class. I finally had enough, when one of my very best students got so frustrated she excused herself from class for about 30 minutes and came back at the end. She stayed after class and said she was very frustrated because she also needed help and had to wait (basically until class was over) because the needy students monopolized class. That was the last straw for me, the fact that I was being stretched too thin by 3 students and I was neglecting the good students in the class because you take for granted the fact that they are on top of things. So I told the students during the next class that I was changing the format of the classroom so that I could give all students an equal amount of time and not dart back and forth across the room the whole time. I said that I would come around to help students 1-on-1 in order and if anyone had a question or needed help before then, they needed to check their resources and work more independently to show resourcefulness. Of course, then the student said \"why do we have to do that? the other students need to speak up if they need help, that's on them\" and I responded that I will not be running my classroom like that. She continued to talk back to me, complained, and talked under her breath. Then asked a bunch of questions and said she needed help. I told her (and another student who was testing me also) that they needed to check their resources and try to find the materials/answers themselves first. Then the student asked me \"Why are you so hostile today?\" now I admit, I said \"because I AM EXHAUSTED\" and I shouldn't have said that, I should have said I am not being hostile, I'm just setting boundaries so we are all successful. or something. But then she said \"we're ALL exhausted\" and it escalated to me saying, this is how I am choosing to run my classroom. There is not going to be a discussion about this. So OF COURSE, she packs up her stuff and starts to leave. To which I said \"You do not have to do this. If you leave, I have to mark you absent. You are accountable for yourself.\" no reply. She left. I continued the second half of my class.\n\nToday (6 days later) I carpooled with my friend (she is also a colleague, another of my student's teachers, and her advisor). She said the student brought up what happened in class to her, and the summary was that I was being petty by marking her absent, I was unwilling to help her, and that I was unreasonable and blah...blah... blah. And that she was \"done\" with me, and was not going to engage in class anymore, then asked my friend if she could help her with MY coursework....(I'm literally screaming into a pillow as I type this)............ Immediately after the student left, my other students who were also in that class told my friend that everything the student said was wrong, and that was not what happened. That she basically threw a tantrum and no other students want to work with her because of her crappy attitude and because she is too hard to deal with.\n\nThe kicker now is I have to be the F-ing grown-up and tell her she has to come to my office before class so we can discuss. And I have to figure out how to diplomatically say this walking out of class is unacceptable and change your attitude or get out of my class. \n\nOH! And also, I told my chair about the other student situation last week and she came to me earlier in the day (same day as student walk out #2) and told me she has \"too much\" on her plate and not to come to her for anything because she's ready to \"snap\" at people and doesn't want to \"snap\" at me. SO I CANNOT GO TO MY CHAIR ABOUT THIS STUDENT. Which is BULLSH\\*T.\n\n\\*\\*End rant\\*\\* Is it summer yet?",

        "title": "I Need Help with Big Decision",
        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am on the verge of making a big decision and getting some new and distanced perspectives would help a lot. My anxiety is through the roof right now (I have severe anxiety disorders, which doesn't help) and any advice/perspectives would help my clouded mind.\n\nI have been working at a university (R1) with my husband for years now and grew more and more frustrated as time went by. I am a temporary employee despite being \"assistant prof of teaching\" and he's tenure-track here. The work I do here is satisfying as the classes I teach (upper level classes) and the students I interact with are good and it's been a pleasure to teach them. The work conditions are also really good. However, the institution is very much isolated (and I'm a foreigner) as this is a college town and there's not much to do around.\n\nThe situation was more and more frustrating because getting tenure-track or permanence where I work was not possible, despite the fact that I'm a very strong prof. They kept alluding to it happening for a long time but alas, nothing happened. This resulted in some tensions between me and the institution. For me, the most important thing is to have security regarding my work, that it can evolve and that I don't have to fear that something may happen to me. Over the last few years, my husband and I both found multiple jobs elsewhere but each time spousal hire was not possible in these other places (the two body problem is very much real). The only thing our current institution could do was to increase my salary as a consequence of some of these offers but I am still temporary (infinitely temporary as no one really gets fired here, but being under that status prevents me from getting promotions for instance), which, given all the good offers we had from other places, is very problematic and unacceptable.\n\nThis year, I found a tenure-track job in a cool location (the city and the state are both nice, albeit very expensive). The job is ok, the teaching load there is slightly higher than where I am, and the classes I would teach there are not very interesting (lower level classes) compared to what I teach at my current place. Additionally, I'm a bit less interested in research than I was in the past (I did a lot of research previously but grew frustrated with academia), but this institution is not research heavy (it's teaching and service heavy) so I won't have to do a ton of it anyway. My husband told me he's willing to leave his tenure-track to be with me. I know that he loves his job a lot but he agrees that we tried everything for a long time now and it didn't work. The chances for him to find another TT job where I will be are very very small, and the institution that offered me the job didn't want to do spousal hire. Given that for us the most important is to live and be together, he is willing to go and see what will happen for him there (he's in a more attractive field than mine, plus we would be in a city, so he would have more chances to find a job in high schools or other places than me for instance). He wouldn't have a salary for the next year at least as well as no health benefits (although I think we can try to have him getting benefits though my future insurance). It might take him a year or so to see what's possible for him, and we'll be tight on our budget, but family can help in the meantime and we don't have kids.\n\nPlot twist however: the moment we announce that I am leaving to another institution, the university I currently work for tells me that they could open a quick search for my position so I can apply and get permanence. They also are putting pressure on my husband to not leave. They knew I was on the job market (and my husband too) and we kept getting offers, but never proposed permanence before. To be fair, it might be a question of timing and administrative mismanagement, so I'm not sure, but I still find their behavior to be really bad regarding the timing and the fact that they could have done so a long time ago. In any case, here we are.\n\nNow, I may have to choose between a permanent non tenure track job that offers very nice classes to teach in an isolated college town and a tenure-track job that offers not great classes to teach in a nice city and state, and I'm torn. My mentors are conflicted about the two, and my husband is also torn as well and thinks both options are good for different reasons. In sum, on one hand, I fear about the classes I would teach at the new institution, and, on the other hand, I fear about being stuck in an insolated location.\n\nWould anyone be willing to share advice/opinions/perspectives to help me out? I realize that the decision is kind of a luxurious one (to a certain extent), and that my panic disorders are kicking in (to my dismay), but I would like to be able to think and decide about it more clearly. Thank you a lot for any help you can provide!",

I work 14 hours a week at the college teaching 10 hours of shop and 4 hours of theory. \n\nThe rest of my time is spent working doing other jobs (occasionally in construction and/or supply teaching at local high schools)\n\nI have a student with a severe learning disability who will not pass my shop portion of the course. Today I got this letter from accessibility services:\n\n \u201c[student] and I met today to review their accommodations. One additional strategy that [student] has noted would be supportive for them is having some 1:1 time to ensure that they understand assignment expectations or feedback. If it is agreeable with you, [student] can connect during your office hours, before/after class, or via an alternate scheduled time depending on what works best for you.\n \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns and thank you in advance for your support.\u201d\n\nI want to handle this as best I can by myself and not always lean on my coordinator, who teaches the same course, to always give me the answers. I am 100% sure this student will fail the class. They have 31% in shop, where most of his mark comes from me doing their work for me to show them (again) how to do it\u2026 and 31% is being generous.\n\nI want to help this student, even though it drastically takes up my time and time away from other students, but I don\u2019t want to spend my extra (unpaid) time to stay after hours. \n\nI\u2019d be more willing to come in early to help the student, but the issue is they never come in on time. They often leave early or misses days as well. They takes no notes during theory, where I explicitly remind students to take notes because I talk thoroughly about the projects, do the math with them, show pictures with examples AND reference from the text book. Students also get rubrics at the start of each project and we go over it together. I tell them to make sure they hit the points in the rubric. There should be absolutely no confusion on what I am looking for.\n\nI\u2019m open to suggestions on how I should reply to the advisor and handle this. \n\nThank you for reading.",

We are there to teach them how to do that, even while we are teaching them chemistry or composition, or whatever. Lots of people on this subreddit seem to forget that.\n\nAnyway, I have hosted a public radio show for fifteen years and the latest episode features four of my students. Amazing people from a flyover state that is usually the butt of jokes. Yet, they are smart, thoughtful, articulate, and full of promise. I couldn't be luckier than I am now, being their professor.\n\nSo, if you have the time, please listen to the podcast as an antidote to the negativity that permeates this subreddit.

I think back to my grad school days when my institution had what we termed a Siberian pipeline, as we had several Russian students come to the program every year.  There were all from Siberia, and all of them (with one exception I lost track of) stayed in the US after finishing their degrees.  It was clear they did not want to return.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was mainly due to the harsh environment of Siberia.  Who wants to live where the temperature regularly far below freezing?  I turned down my first offer because it was in South Dakota - too cold!  My na\u00efve views weren't dispelled by my colleagues' reticence in describing their homeland, but over time I got to know that it wasn't the geographical environment, but the social one that kept them from returning.  A student in my cohort had really bad teeth from years of no treatment (I noticed because as a rural WVian, I struggled with dental issues for years).  A really top-notch student had no feeling in his fingers due to nerve damage from his time at university in Russia where there were no gloves for working with neurotoxins.  His wife, also a grad student) grimaced every time they spoke of where they were from (not home - just a place where they grew up).  For me, grad school was an escape from the rural poverty of my home; for them, it was an escape from a horrific system that had no value for them.\n\nAll those years of interacting with Russians (and later meeting other Eastern bloc people) have shaded my perspective in some of our discussions.  When we go on screeds against the fascism of the US and Canada (and occasionally some Western European partners), I find it difficult to take seriously.  We certainly have some bad ideas, but we have the ability to openly discuss, oppose, and replace those bad ideas with better ones.  We can make change and social progress.  We can act as individuals, as organization, as corporations, and more outside of acting as the government.  It's chaotic and messy (and frustrates my own desire for order at times), but that has allowed our societies to progress and address the inequities of the past - maybe not as quickly as we'd like nor necessarily in the ways we would choose, but we do generally make progress.  I just wish more of us here would not be so quick to label people with opposing viewpoints as fascists or imperialists.  There's a great example of empire building and it's not the U.S.; they're not even second place.",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI understand that this post will open some potentially divisive discussion, but here goes. I am a doctoral candidate who is an adjunct at a local community college as well. I've had a rocky start (see my old posts on this thread about the PSY 101 class with only dual enrolled students in their high school) that is further compounded by my pre-existing neurodivergent (ASD, ADHD-I) and mental health (mainly social phobia) conditions. I will also say that while it is not an official diagnosis, many of my social phobia symptoms and other tendencies are in line with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) in case that is helpful info. HR also has my accommodations, which I made sure they had from the start.\n\nDespite my social phobia and adversarial advisors I've had (with the exception of my current advisor), I managed to stick it out to the halfway point of teaching two 16-week classes at this community college. I would still like to teach for sure, but I am finding it difficult to address feedback from a recent observer so I can be more expressive and less monotone. I will say that the monotone voice is an ASD characteristic and a cognitive limitation. For example, if I focus on my inflection and \"act,\" I will lose my train of thought. \n\nI stand behind a podium or sit down during lectures at times as a coping mechanism so I feel like I am safe. When I do so, I do not have a shaky voice and am less prone to anxiety. I should note that I have started standing in my PSY 101 class but do not pace because I would block students' view in the otherwise small classroom. I have not done so for my PSY 103 class. I have also started looking at students' foreheads or the top of their heads to fake eye contact because I can do eye contact, just not prolonged eye contact (something I learned the hard way recently). I also have somewhat of an anxious reaction to when they look at me and it is an ambiguous expression I cannot read.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I would like to hear from anyone else who has one or many different conditions I have too (RSD included).",

        "title": "Academic crazyland (or, trapped in a 12-month appointment)",
        "body": "Hi friends,\n\nI am in a cycle of hell that could only happen in academia and need insight from others who know this world. \n\nA few years ago, I was hired by a R1 university to direct a graduate program. I have a PhD, and a PhD was required for the job (of course it was!). But the position I was hired to had (for various reasons) long been classified as \"staff.\" At the point I was hired, this was sorta good news for me, 'cause I've always worked in staff roles in my previous univ jobs. This made it actually possible that I could get this job (unlike senior rank faculty jobs, which always seem to require you to already have climbed the faculty ladder somewhere else, which I hadn't).\n\nAfter a couple years in the role, however, it was very clear to me that the actual situation in this job was that the university was asking me to function as faculty without the benefit of faculty status. After all, I'm directing a degree-granting program. I am in charge of curriculum, admissions, hiring faculty to teach, etc. I advise students, chair master's committees, teach. All of this without the benefit of even getting emails from the provost's office to \"faculty.\" Other faculty would have to tell me about those b/c I never got them.\n\nThis became untenable, and through a yearlong chain of events, I was able to get my position converted from staff to faculty (non-tenure line, but permanent faculty position). This is, on the whole, a great step!\n\nHowever, when this was done -- without even saying \"boo\" to me -- \"they\" (HR-ish folk, I think) insisted that I be put on a 12-month faculty contract, rather than the 9-month contracts that nearly all other faculty in my university outside of the medical school have (I'm in the humanities). \n\nWhile all of this was happening, I competed for and was awarded an internal university grant for my research. The grant included \"summer salary.\" However, once I was put in a 12-mo appointment, I was told I couldn't get the grant $$ b/c \"12-mo faculty can't get summer salary.\"\n\nI have been trying to get my (newly arrived) dean to fix this by agreeing to let me be moved to a 9-mo appointment. This dean wasn't here when most of the above processes happened.  They are telling me, though, that \"HR\" is telling them that because the original position I was hired into was \"12-mo\" \\[of course it was, it was a \"staff\" position; they are all \"12-mo\"\\], that I have to remain 12-mo. This despite the fact that the conversion to faculty actually moved me into a different job classification.  \n\nThe dean is further saying that all their career they were in 12-mo \"faculty\" positions in various schools of medicine and they always did research, so I should be able to do that, too. They tell me that when they got grants in that role, they didn't get any salary bump, they \"just used the money to buy supplies and do research.\" \n\nWhen they say this, I feel my head spinning around. My original position (the staff one) didn't require or even mention \"research.\" So the thought that somehow now I just do research -- essentially adding value to the university -- while my conditions otherwise remain unchanged feels all wrong to me. It feels like the dean is creating a false equivalency between their former 12-mo \"faculty\" roles (in which research was surely a key component) and mine (which, as noted, seems still to be governed by the rules of my \"staff\" role and didn't include research). \n\nI feel like I'm in crazyland and can't escape. I know in my gut that to remain 12-mo, but also do the research I proposed to do with the grant I was awarded is effectively to add new work for myself -- now with no compensation of any kind.  The only way I see to get compensation is to shift to 9-mo, like EVERYONE ELSE, thus, opening space in my year for \"research\" and allowing the compensation to come. \n\nTalk to me about how you'd think this through.  I feel like when I talked to the dean about this, I didn't have my head clear.",

My dissertation was 'good', but a collection of 'this showed that \"A\" does not support our hypothesis'.  My dissertation also included some unpublished work from a previous graduate student, he said it was not an issue, as I was interpreting the results and did not claim to have run the experiment (he didn't want to pay to repeat the 'unsuccessful' experiment, but the results were important for the project), which I get, but it always bothered me.\n\nSince I graduated, I feel like I let down my PI (no publications, no grants) and my Ph.D. was a sham.  \n\nI am past it to an extent, but am curious, how often does this happen?\n\nI should add, I def. put in the work (spent 60-70 hours in the lab every week, weekends, football games, holidays), crush my orals (had some issues with written evals however).\n\nIn the end my committee awarded me my degree... but...    \n(not sure why this still bothers me)",

I really don't understand this mentality. \n\nTo be clear: when I get notifications from the powers that be on behalf of a student, even after the fact, that is fine - those are documented issues, and it is understandable that the student may not have been able to communicate. I'm talking about the ones that just didn't do it, got an extension already but want a longer extension, or just assume for whatever reason their late work will be accepted and send me a long story about why. Yes, I have provisions in the syllabus addressing this. \n\nWith &gt;500 students, it is really overwhelming to have to deal with this (I legitimately get physically ill from anxiety because my continuance at my job depends on student evals), but I feel like for the students who scrambled to get it done, the only fair thing is to say no.",

Sometimes, this looks like yelling and anger applied to less senior (usually female) faculty to halt discussion. Sometimes, it looks like white tears.

Unfortunately, both offenders have a history of getting what they want out of yelling/tears.\n\nWe follow Roberts Rules here. This kind of thing strikes me as a violation but I'm not sure how to point out the problem and redirect the conversation in more fruitful directions (especially without looking like a total bitch).

        "body": "For the longest time, I've been pretty adamantly opposed to any weapons in the classroom, like many professors.  But, over these past 15ish years, I've seen a sizable switch in demeanor among our students.\n\nYou see, we're a smaller SLAC (undergrads only) institution with several larger universities dotted around us, all within, say, an hour or so drive.  Some are public, some are private, but there used to be a sort of unspoken agreement that the universities wouldn't really dip into our student body \"pool\" of applicants.  So we rarely got the absolute best of the best, but we also kept our standards a bit higher.  Students, as recently as, say, six or seven years ago, were mostly good students, with a few great students sprinkled in.\n\nThere's plenty of metrics that show us this phenomenon, but at some point, a few of those larger universities, in order to boost their own enrollment, started to \"dip\" into our usual pool, growing their incoming classes by admitting students who were our great ones and a good number of our good ones.  In response, our institution has had to dig into \"lower\" achieving students in order to keep our own enrollment up.\n\nSince then, it's become apparent that a lot of these lower achieving students (though certainly not all) have mental health issues or are just not ready for college, and respond aggressively when they are met with any sort of challenge from a professor.  The number of \"incidents\" on campus have skyrocketed, with students throwing chairs, vandalizing things, pushing professors and staff, getting into fights and arguments with one another, and even a few who have stalked professors.  \n\nIn response, the administration has held a series of \"discussions\" about what to do about the problem, the end result of which was already determined before the discussions even began: if it's in your classroom, you handle it.  Call security.  We'll do something about it eventually (most of the time, unless the behavior is legit \"criminal,\" they don't, and the student stays enrolled).\n\nUnfortunately, we're a smaller campus and the security personnel consists of people who are retirees or former loss prevention folks from local department stores.  They don't even have access to Segways or golf carts to get around campus, and they are all unarmed.  They're all nice people, but one guy has a bad hip and shuffles from place to place, once taking almost a half an hour to cross campus and unlock a door for me.  Often, the daily security \"team\" consists of two people, and they aren't there at all in the evenings.  There's an agreement that the city police can come out to patrol, but they rarely do, because, you know, they have other districts and areas to cover as well.\n\nI feel exposed and completely without assistance.  I also know I've been fortunate so far, because my interactions with these students have been minimal.  Still, I can't help but feel that the lack of response/apathy from the administration is going to pay dividends these days.\n\nI'm not a big \"gun person,\" but I've never been \"anti gun,\" whatever that may mean.  I already have a CCL; the local policies, though, prevent weapons on campus.  Yet, not too long ago, I was talking to my spouse, and was surprised to hear myself saying that I'd consider carrying if the campus policies changed to allow it.\n\nIs anyone else feeling/seeing this breakdown?  An increasingly angry and aggressive student population coupled with an increasingly (if that were possible) apathetic administration?",

I\u2019m so angry right now I have no idea what to do. This is fresh off the heels of discovering one student straight up submitting code from ChatGPT, and others doing the same but at least having the sense to chance the variables so I don\u2019t have a case against them. I\u2019m ready to throw in the towel, these students (particularly in our program and those whom had the majority of their undergraduate classes online due to COVID) are truly something else.",

        "body": "Hey friends,\n\nNew to the forum.  I am up for a position at a new institution as my old college is winding down my department.  \n\nIn my field, the best days to teach are Monday/Wednesday courses, and AM is better than PM.  These days are less likely to interfere with my research time off-campus because Monday is the day most people take off in the field.  At my current college, they have worked the schedule so I teach mostly on Mondays with one class that also meets Wednesday AM.  It has been ideal and allowed me to give my students my full attention but also continue to do my work off campus when I need to.\n\nAt my current school this has been an informal arrangement with the chair, but I am wondering if it is something that I should bring up during contract negotiations for the new position. Has anyone ever negotiated WHEN they teach their load?\n\nThanks!",

Though about 80% of my students are between fine and outstanding, I have about 20% of students that are grade-grubby incessant complainers. How do you deal with them?   \n\n\nSome examples of annoying student behaviors:  \n\n1. Student A wants to have everything I say in lecture to be written on the PowerPoint slides. I want them to engage with lecture and take notes as necessary. I provide students with the slides I present in class, but they do not include every single word I utter in class. \n2. Student B 'feels' as though they wrote a method section in a research paper they earned a 0 on. I asked them to make sure to watch the lecture videos (since they have not been bothered to attend class in person) and view sample student papers before we meet for office hours. They came to office hours and tried to argue with me about how their paper deserved more than a 0. When I asked if they'd viewed the lectures and/or downloaded the sample papers, they said no because they couldn't find them on our course Blackboard. No other student has claimed they can't find resources on our course Blackboard. \n3. Student A (again) asks if I can find a research paper for them. Finding a research paper is requirement of an assignment. \n4. Student C complains that I did not provide enough instruction on how to write a research paper. They were absent the entire week I went over the first draft requirements. I have a template on how to write a research paper they can open (already formatted in APA), videos, and student papers. And somehow I failed them. \n\nThese are just a few examples of what I have dealt with this term. Never in a million years would I, as a student, have engaged with my professors the way these students have engaged with me.\n\nOur school is bleeding money and admits around 90% of students who apply. This might partially explain the lack of ...whatever it is that makes students feel this entitled.   \n\n\nAnother note - student evaluations are an important component of the tenure and promotion process at my institution. These three students (and a few other bozos) will likely tank my evals because they are not being spoon fed assignments and given 100% on assignments for effort.   \n\n\nSo I have a few questions: \n\n1. How do I respond to these insane student demands? \n2. What should/can I do to avoid these kinds of behaviors from starting in the first place, next term? \n3. How do you manage to keep your cool in these circumstances? I feel like my face betrays me in these interactions because I simply cannot believe some of their asks. \n\nThanks!",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nI am eagerly yet anxiously applying for a TT humanities position with the department from which I earned my MA. I have since completed a PhD at a different university and I am now a year deep into a very rewarding full-time job at a two-year college.\n\nI have a few questions if anyone can offer advice. First, what is appropriate here? Do I mention my connection with and enthusiasm for this specific program in my cover letter or trust that they will already know these things? I am Facebook friends with the chair of the search committee\u2014is it wrong to make a post about how excited I am to apply given that he will likely see it?\n\nAlso, I know it is conventional to explain where you found the position in the first paragraph of the cover letter. Usually that means \"as advertised in the Chronicle of Higher Ed...\" but in my case I found out because half a dozen people instantly contacted me about it the day it went up. They all knew it was my dream job haha. Can I say something like \"as referred to me by several academic colleagues?\" Is the word *referral* inappropriate because it suggests people within the university I am applying to? If so, is there a better word I could use? I'm struggling to think of an effective synonym.\n\nThank you for your help! This is such a stressful process. I would choose this job over Harvard or Stanford or anywhere really, and they are a small department that doesn't hire often. This is likely my only shot at this. To say I am stressed is an understatement.",

Getting insight into exactly what academic life is like in NZ, however, has been a bit trickier. I've spoken to a few people, but they haven't been lengthy conversations. I get the impression that there is much better work-life balance, less pressure to publish, higher expectations for cultural competence, and a stronger emphasis on teaching quality (relative to where I'm coming from). Overall, I *think* I have a good idea of what I'd be walking into professionally, but as the saying goes: you don't know what you don't know.\n\nAre there any NZ academics who can shed some light here?\n\n1. What is academic life like in NZ? (Any word on how else it compares to North America?)\n2. Is there anything specific I should be especially mindful of as it relates to my offer letter (other than salary, relocation funds)?\n3. Is it common for some factors (e.g., teaching load, start-up funds) to *not* be included in the offer letter itself (though have it in another form of writing)?\n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts!",

My spouse just read a chapter this friend submitted for a relatively public-facing workshop, and my spouse recognized their ideas and phrases and told me so I took a look and agree, having read my spouse\u2019s work over the last decade. \n\nEntire phrases and ideas are lifted from my spouse\u2019s dissertation - I know my ex-friend is far more than passingly familiar with my spouse\u2019s research and argument (close association for the better part of a decade involving writing groups, sharing chapter drafts, talking causally about our work etc.), and having read the chapter draft myself there is no mistaking the fact that my ex-friend read my spouse\u2019s dissertation and took ideas verbatim without citing my spouse. \n\nMy spouse is sure that if I bring it up in any way, my ex-friend will just either A) cite them in a minor way that obscures my spouse\u2019s ideas or B) cover their tracks. But the fact will remain that my ex-friend took my spouse\u2019s argument to pass off as their own without any consideration or discussion about it and is actively benefitting professionally. \n\nI\u2019m boiling mad. There\u2019s no way this is an honest mistake. My spouse is assuring me they are ok, but I\u2019m also angry that this ex-friend has been building a career in a crazy competitive field while being absolutely dishonest at the expense of my spouse. \n\nWtf do I do?",

I've had colleagues who have had students directly cheat on an exam by hiding a textbook or notes in the bathroom, then asking for a restroom break in the middle of an exam. But it seems like the approach I've been taking to address this has a big loophole...\n\nMy class (and exams) are roughly 2 hours in length...though you can finish in under an hour if you're prepared. For the past year, I've been dividing the exam into two standalone parts. You complete part 1, turn it in, then you can take a break (restroom, water, etc.). Once you come back, you get part 2. So there's really no opportunity to cheat.\n\nIt works well, except during part 2 of my Monday midterm, I had a student come to me 20 minutes after they started and tell me they really had to use the restroom. I asked them why they didn't use it during the break, and all they could say is that they didn't have to, and now they really, really did. I let them go, because they seemed sincere, and I couldn't in good conscience let someone piss their pants. Not to mention what kind of liability it might open me up to.\n\nSo is there just no way around this? If a student is intent on cheating, they could just insist that they have to use the restroom, and I'm in trouble if I guess wrong and they end up soiling themselves...\n\nJust curious if anyone has a \"foolproof\" way of handling this.",

There were usually a few other students from the class hanging around a bulletin board for the same reason -- to scan the sheet of paper that listed our grades, highest to lowest, identifiable only by our ID#. I think that knowing I was going to see my score in a ranked list, even though I wasn't identified by name, added an incentive. \"How far down will I have to scan before finding my ID?\" made me want to try to experience the thrill of being near the top. \n\nCompare that to today, when scores appear automatically on a student's LMS dashboard, completely detached from everyone else's. I'm tempted to post their scores the old-fashioned way--again, only identifying by ID#--but something tells me today's students would freak out, as they sometimes do when shown the grade distribution. I'm thinking about this after having graded an exam on which they performed horribly, asking myself over and over, \"Have they no shame?\", then realizing that their score is just an isolated number on the screen, and they don't have the perspective of seeing their score ranked among their peers.\n\nHas anyone had any success with some sort of incentive beyond the lure of the gpa?",

I was in a very unhappy marriage and was kept isolated and unable to make friends, so I used teaching as a way to fulfill my need for social interaction. That resulted in me becoming a workaholic and creating a dependency on teaching as a form of self-validation.\n\nSince starting therapy and leaving the marriage, things have been slowly been improving. However, there have still been a lot of challenges. Because I was struggling so much, any time I had any kind of physical or mental health complication, everything just felt unbearable. And, of course, neglecting your health results in more health complications...I cancelled class 4 times in the span of a couple months, which is a lot. It's not something I normally do, but it's not like I had the ability to take a semester off. Gotta pay the bills. \n\nI realized that one of the big reasons I felt compelled to cancel class was because I was getting really overwhelmed and breaking down. Keeping up with everything just felt incredibly difficult, and no matter how much I tried to get things in order, everything always felt like a chaotic mess. In addition to other aspects of improving my mental health, I ended up getting diagnosed with ADHD. Being on ADHD meds has made such a huge impact. In addition to the executive dysfunction impacts, it's made a difference on my ability to handle problems. Even though I have days where I feel really shitty, I still actually feel motivated to go to work (not that people should be workaholics, but self-sabotage due to untreated ADHD has been a challenge for me).\n\nIf you've been on the fence about therapy or addressing particular mental health issues, look into it!",

To what extent should academic work integrate chatGPT into their working environments?\n\nI am a research coordinator/lead author at a university think tank. I frequently work on several projects simultaneously that involve much grunt writing (too often I find if I want something done right I have to do it myself \ud83d\ude44 OR have chatGPT do it and then revise its work). I have found that chatGPT has greatly reduced the bottle neck of mundane writing that I often face. My main responsibility in my role is ensuring conceptual coordination and academic consistency, which is detracted from when I have to spend hours editing other peoples writing or write basic but time consuming sections. By using chatGPT, I have been able to spend less time on my more menial tasks and have become incredibly more productive. Since discovering chatGPT I have doubled my academic output. I am not using it to recuse my effort but to increase the fruits of said effort. I care deeply about the integrity of my work, I care deeply about uncovering truths and interpreting/presenting them appropriately/responsibly. I believe honestly that chatGPT greatly enhances my potential contributions to human knowledge. Do my fellow academics disapprove of my chatGPT use?",

        "body": "Today at a department meeting, a fellow faculty member shared some frustrations about an accommodation she was asked to make for a student. During the conversation, I made the comment that she could have said no, because it seemed like an extremely unreasonable accommodation. I then found out that most of the faculty at the meeting had no idea that accommodations were supposed to be reasonable and they assumed they had do anything the disability office asked, no matter what. This led to additional discussion of how some faculty pushed back and were told they had no choice in the matter.\n\nSo I know that the ADA dictates that accommodations should be reasonable and I know the general definition of reasonable. However, I also know that the ADA doesn't dictate how an institution determines if an accommodation is reasonable (i.e., does the disability office decide everything, is it a joint effort between faculty and disability office, etc.). \n\nFrom a logical perspective, it makes sense for the disability office to work with faculty in figuring these things out. The people in the disability office aren't going to be familiar with every course offered and don't have access to syllabi and learning outcomes at the time that they send out accommodation letters. So while something like extra time on assignments might be reasonable for one course, it could be unreasonable for another. However, from searching through posts on this sub, it seems that there some institutions don't allow faculty input.\n\nDoes anyone have links to any resources that support the paradigm that faculty should be involved with the determination of what is reasonable? It's kind of wild that someone who is not even remotely an expert in most subjects being taught at an institution could have the only say on whether or not a proposed accommodation will alter the nature and learning outcomes of a course or place an undue burden on faculty.",

It seems that AI is irreversible, and instead of telling students that they cannot use it, they need to be taught how to use it responsibly. This is my best attempt to achieve that goal.\n\n**The Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence:**\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in our daily lives, it is crucial for students to understand the ethical considerations surrounding its use in academic settings. In this course, students are expected to use AI in a manner which upholds the values of academic integrity. In general, the use of AI should never compromise development in critical thinking, research, and analysis. Along that line, the use of AI to generate content, manipulate the tone of work, create data, or summarize/shorten an author\u2019s work for quicker consumption is considered academic dishonesty and strictly prohibited.\n\nAlternatively, students are encouraged towards using AI to assist in research and writing process in ways which encourage the learning process and mitigate menial tasks. For example, students may use AI to create a table to help visualize complex data, develop personalized learning and reading plans, and assist in correcting grammar and spelling errors.\n\nPlease note that any unethical use of AI in this course will be considered academic dishonesty and may result in disciplinary action. Students are responsible for ensuring that their use of AI is in compliance with the course policies on academic integrity.",

Feel free to add on.\n\nWARNING, reading list may trigger eye rolling or academic trauma:\n\n1. The student that is supposedly struggling but boasts about wanting advice on how to do good in the class because they want to go to law school/med school  but then puts in pathetic effort or rarely shows up to class.\n2. When a student comes to every office hours just to ask the same career quest questions every time. Like why are u whining over not knowing which minor you should take...Very annoying.\n3. The \"Hi I  have attached my essay can u have a look before I submit it\" No. I will not read 15 pages in my free time. Ask me about a thesis sure but nothing else.\n4. The ones that dont attend class because they have mental health issues or their grandma dies weekly but they want supplementary ways to make up their grades.\n5. The class clown who is everything but funny-- just disruptive and immature\n6. the friends who are always yapping in class while u teach and dont shut up\n7. the ones that miss instructions that are in front of their face and act all shocked when you bring it up\n8. The essay long emails of excuses to submit work later",

(there are some emotional stressors having to do with regular, horrible student experiences, but i at least know about that part, it makes sense to me already.)\n\ndoes anyone know about like, idk, psych research on this? what is going on here? i am definitely not in one of these states right now thus leading me to write this post!!!!!! anyway i know reading about it analytically won't make it better on its own, but i do wonder if it could help me cope. your advice is also welcome!",

        "body": "First off, thank you all for this community. I occasionally post with another account, but I feel the need to create a burner for this post, which is about an incredibly-positive thing that my stupid brain is somehow making into a negative. Over the last few years I have had several negative events in my personal life corrupt how I think when I am by myself.\n\nI am at a SLAC with somewhat-decent management, some prestige, and provides a lot of freedom to do what I want with my career. It is a great job. I have a particularly good deal in terms of teaching load and preps, I love teaching undergraduates, and after a few years I'm a huge favorite among students despite the difficulty of my classes. I am very involved in faculty governance and several major service commitments across campus and within my department, and faculty are very appreciative of my work. I'm very well-known in my field with my research. I earned tenure at the end of year three after my dean offered me the option to go up early. We are now in year four.\n\nI am currently in a very high cost of living and very low quality of life location, and the only problem with my position is the compensation relative to my output. My salary is constrained due to equity-related reasons (I do not benefit from tight equity bands across fields). As a result, I cannot buy a home here, even if I wanted to.\n\nI am occasionally asked to apply to other department searches by R1 departments. One came up recently that was exciting for a combination of amenities and pay. The new location is similar cost and comes with an incredible quality of life increase. My current salary (numbers fuzzed a bit) is around 90k (for comparable SLACs/my field, should be 110k for associates), and the offer on the table is 165k, with a very generous pension plan that will pay out more per year than what I would ever make as a full here. I am obviously taking the position. There is absolutely no way my home university can come close to this offer. I can't believe offers like this even exist.\n\nI have worked around 100 hours per week for several years now because my current job is the exact thing I have always wanted since the moment I found out about what an LAC was. I have enjoyed every moment for the last four years. And I love the staff and faculty at this university. The town can screw off though.\n\nThe new job takes me away from the small, diverse classes and undergraduate interactions that I love, and is a more \"sterile\" learning environment from what I gathered. It is not the best fit for me. And so I feel very very bad about leaving this place. The same place that has gotten me at a very large discount for four years. The same place that will continue to take 100 hours per week from me. Maybe the idea is that at the new place I would work less and enjoy those amenities a lot more.\n\nI don't have anyone at my institution I can talk to about this. My closest friends are related to the university. And my family is very anti-academic. So thank you for reading this.",

Better than the previous spring.\n\nThis semester I had 1 or 2 until this past week. We\u2019re halfway and I think they\u2019re feeling the midterm pressure. I\u2019m only about 5% of my students and happy they\u2019re seeking help.  \n\nI\u2019ve also had far fewer \u201cdemands\u201d for points back they \u201cdeserve\u201d compared with last semester, which is nice. \n\nLast semester and continuing into this semester I have been more strict about my email responses.

This semester, though, I have a 40-something student who is severely trying my patience.\n\nThis student is ex-military and is very vocal about the fact that her ADHD was \"more accommodated\" in the military (meaning, I think, that she could simply follow orders without having to think too hard about what she was doing). She feels very strongly that somebody should tell her exactly what to do every second of every day, so that she can get a passing grade without having to manage her own time or do any independent thinking, and she doesn't feel the blame should be on her if she fails to do something without multiple reminders and personal help. If she isn't being told to do something by someone else at that exact moment, she makes whatever assumption allows her to do the least work, then acts as if it's everyone else's fault for not telling her differently when that doesn't work out for her. A few representative examples:\n\n* I'm still learning how to use a computer, so I signed up for in-person classes on the assumption that no computer use would be required. You need to provide paper versions of the all the Canvas assignments and let me turn them in on paper, because I was misled about the modality of this course.\n* I didn't understand how to submit assignments on Canvas, so I assumed the assignments on Canvas weren't being graded and I didn't do them. I didn't ask for clarification because I assumed you would tell me if they had to be turned in. Since you made me use Canvas despite my completely reasonable request for accommodations and then didn't make your expectations clear, I feel that I should be allowed to turn in all the assignments I missed for full credit.\n* As I've previously stated, I had assumed that I wouldn't need any computer skills for this course, so I don't think I should have to do the Powerpoint presentation for the final project. You need to provide me with an alternative assignment so that I can demonstrate my understanding in a way that works for me. Also, you need to find my sources for me because I don't understand how to use the library database and I'm too busy with other classes to go to the library in person.\n* I didn't understand what a lab practical was, so I assumed it was a paper exam like the lecture exam. I then assumed that it would be available to take all week in the testing center, just like the lecture exam, so I didn't study for it in time and that's why I failed. You should let me retake it because even though you said in class multiple times that it was taking place at our scheduled lab time, and it was on the syllabus that hasn't changed since January, nobody specifically told *me* about it, so there's no way I could have known.\n\nThis student is also incessantly disruptive in class and lab. She marches in 10-30 minutes late most days, makes a ton of noise unpacking her bookbag, and then proceeds to yell out bizarre \"not even wrong\" answers to all of my questions. Despite having failed or just not turned in every assignment so far, she seems to believe that she understands the material better than anyone else in the room and sometimes tries to argue with me if I correct her (for instance, she believes that \"competitive inhibitors work better\" and will not accept any challenges to that idea, because \"that's what 'competitive' means\"). If I ignore her because she's being disruptive and not making any sense, she huffs and acts offended that I'm not fawning over her ability to scream sciencey-sounding nonsense louder than anyone else. In lab, she wanders aimlessly around the room trying to socialize with other students and, if asked why she isn't doing the lab activity, falls back on the \"nobody TOLD me I had to do anything!\" excuse. She needs to be redirected to task roughly every five minutes or she'll wander off to do something else, feeling absolutely certain that she has no obligations and is free to do what she wants. Even for a community college student, this level of sheer apathy is frankly exceptional.\n\nTo top it off, this student has a terrible influence on the classrom environment. She sucks up to higher-achieving students in a way that clearly creeps them out, then expects unconditional help with her schoolwork because she's being \"such a great friend.\" She pushes these people to the limits of their patience, then plays the victim when they inevitably lose their temper and call her out on it. Three times already this semester, she has come to me to tearfully report that another student has been \"abusing\" her on account of her disability and that I need to take action to protect her from them, only to reveal when pressed that what she means by \"abuse\" is something like \"they told me I had to be on time to class in a way that wasn't perfectly kind and understanding, and that hurt my feelings.\" Lately she's been complaining that she feels like I'm not taking these complaints seriously because I like the students she's complaining about more than I like her (she's technically correct about both things, but not about the causal relationship) and hinting that she may have to go over my head to \"make sure this is dealt with appropriately.\" Thankfully the department chair and dean are pretty no-nonsense folks who are unlikely to be receptive to her arguments, but it still irks me that she's throwing accusations of abuse around to get other students in trouble because they won't give her what she wants.\n\nWe are now approaching the point in the semester at which it will be mathematically impossible for her to pass if she doesn't turn things around PDQ. I look forward to the inevitable barrage of e-mails (she has no problem sending those, despite harping on about her technological illiteracy as an excuse for not doing her work) about how this isn't her fault because I didn't support her to succeed to the best of her ability, and she actually deserves an A for having to deal with me.",

So I am curious if anyone knows of an alternative site that does the same thing.\n\nBasically I want to give students a choice of five topics for a group presentation. Each student ranks these topics by personal preference (1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.)  The Poll &amp; Match website would then construct student teams in a way that maximize student preferences. (In a typical case for a class of 30 students it would find team assignments so that all but one or two students got their 1st or 2nd choice of topics.)\n\nDoes anyone know of an automated way to solicit student preferences and construct team assignments on that basis?\n\nIt's looking like I am going to have to go back to my \"old school\" method of having students write down their preferences on a notecard and then manually figure out teams myself based on these responses.

        "body": "Hello all. \n\nTaking notes, and using them, is an ever-evolving field. We've used pen and paper, different apps and programs, and different approaches on what to jot down. \n\nI typically give some advice to new students, pointing out different approache and tools for note taking. These include Cornell-style notes, zettelkasten, Obsidian, etc.\n\nIt occurred to me some time ago that teaching \"how to use notes\" is as important as taking them, and have been wondering how many of you teach on how to _utilise_ notes efficiently?\n\nSo, my question is, how do you teach note-taking and note-using?\n\nI find this especially interesting, since there recently have been notes of somekind of change going on with the students capabilities.",

I\u2019ve had a few interviews for postdocs and first round interview for decent non-tt/teaching professor jobs, and I\u2019m feeling really bummed that I haven\u2019t been offered any of the positions I interviewed for. Prior to entering academia, I was very successful with job interviews. I also only had in-person and phone ones prior to the zoom/pandemic era. \n\nFor those of you who have been on the other end of things, what would you say is a sign that a zoom interview went well? What is a sign that it didn\u2019t? It\u2019s hard for me to read the zoom room. E.g. in one of my interviews one of the interviewers kept turning off his camera to deal with some kind of childcare situation, and I wasn\u2019t sure how I was supposed to react to that. Other times the interviewers seemed really interested and engaged, and it stings to not be a first choice. Is it just a matter of there being better candidates than myself, or am I bombing my zoom interviews?\n\nI\u2019m in the Humanities and have a PhD from a good public R1. I have some older publications and one pretty good article forthcoming, no book contract but have an editor and press I\u2019m working with to get one. I\u2019ve also had some competitive fellowships/grants and my dissertation was nominated for a special national award. I know there are better candidates out there with more publications and elite degrees, but I\u2019m competitive enough to get interviews in my subfield. I think something will work out for me this year, but I\u2019ll have to go through it all again for tt jobs so I figured I\u2019d ask for advice now!\n\nFor the person who will inevitably ask this question, I\u2019m a white woman in my 30s &amp; a member of an ethno-religious minority (Judaism). That\u2019s not demographic info that applications require but it\u2019s obvious from my name &amp; appearance &amp; research.",

        "body": "So I\u2019m going to preface this by saying this is a long story. However it\u2019s full of ups and downs, good luck and bad luck, and politics. \n\nSo I used to be an adjunct. Several years ago I attended an MBA program. I went into the program doing everything I possibly could, and giving back as much as I could. My professors all knew me as an overachiever, the staff of the program knew me as a staunch ally and a person dedicated to the school (it was my alma mater as well as my B-school). I went to every event, got nearly all A\u2019s, was inducted into the highest honor society for busines school graduates, and made friends with my instructors. \n\nI received a professional job through my efforts with the program\u2019s recruiting services as well. In the end, I was happy, got out of a job I hated, and I moved away to work in that job for a little while. Around a year or so later I had the opportunity to move back to the same city I got my degree in. I reconnected with one of my professors and expressed my interest in one day teaching at the university level. He said he loved that idea and had mentored others and said we should stay in contact and we did for several months with him offering advice. \n\nWhile attending an alumni event shortly thereafter, I met the director of the program and mentioned the same thing. That I would like to teach \u201cone day\u201d. He said, \u201cwhy wait?\u201d \n\nHe arranged a meeting with me and asked me to put together a syllabus on a topic for an elective class and to get letters of recommendation from my professors. I got letters from all but one of my professors from the program recommending me as an instructor. I also spent weeks building the perfect syllabus on a subject I was an expert in. When I presented it to him, he said \u201calright! You\u2019re hired! I\u2019ll get you on the schedule! And he told me how impressed he was. \n\nExcited, and probably a little too eagerly (hey I was young and over the moon), thinking it was a done deal, I changed my LinkedIn to reflect my new role. There was the mistake. I got a call a few weeks later from him stating that the dean had seen my LinkedIn profile and thought I was \u201cuppity\u201d. He said that unfortunately that meant I wasn\u2019t going to teach that year. \n\nDevastated, I took it down, tried to reach out to the dean, who didn\u2019t respond, and went over a year not teaching the class I had envisioned. \n\nStill. I wanted to teach. I worked hard to get on the schedule, doing everything in my power to teach because I really wanted to (and had wanted to ever since undergrad TAing) and the director eventually called me back and gave me an opportunity. He told me to stay away from the dean because it seemed he had forgotten about me but that HE believed in me and wanted to give me a shot. \n\nI taught a class. And it was great. Being on the lowest end of the totem pole, it was a Saturday morning class with few students- despite an interesting subject. Still, I had amazing students and when the class was over I had the highest marks from the class review than any other class in the program. With this success I planned to hopefully teach more and take over the main class in my subject area eventually. I thought maybe I could become a full time instructor in a few years and maybe get involved in administration. I told this to the director and he said he would mentor me. \n\nSo I taught my class a few more times and then I got a call from the director. My mentor was sick and he needed someone to cover 4 courses of over 150 students in a subject I was not an expert in and he needed the class to be ready in a month. While I wanted to say no, my director said he was in a bind and it was also the class that my professor mentor was teaching. So I put the course together and worked my butt off teaching it , all while working a full time role and having a young infant at home. Granted the class wasn\u2019t awesome but I tweaked it to be an experiential one, and I had several students tell me they got jobs from the things I taught them. \n\nFeeling confident, and secure, and having started a PhD program in my field, I started attending faculty events. You know where this is going. I wasn\u2019t flashy, but the dean saw me at one of these events and developed a deep scowl. He didn\u2019t say anything to me but my director said he remembered me after that and to be careful. I didn\u2019t think anything about it until a few weeks later my professor mentor passed away. Less than two months later the director of the program also unexpectedly passed. It was a shock to me because he was in his mid 50s. An interim director was appointed and he was the associate Dean. I offered to help with some of the Director duties but was politely declined. Having worked towards a goal of administration I applied for the director role. I didn\u2019t receive an interview or even a response to my application. Someone who was also an alumni of the program was chosen for the role. I was shocked because they were similar to me in experience and education. I was also shocked because I knew everyone in the program and had references from administrative staff. Once the new person came into the school, I offered to help in any way I could and asked for an in person meeting to share my hopes for the direction of the program and my role within it. That request was put off and I figured because they were new and wanted to get their feet wet first. Meanwhile I had been working on teaching in a different school in our university and in a different part of our school. While receiving positive interactions at first, behaviors suddenly changed and I was told they were no longer interested. Attempts to follow up were also ignored or brushed off.\n\nThen the worst happened. I got contacted by the new director and she told me that I was no longer required to teach any classes at the university and that if I was needed in the future she would reach out. \n\nWhile again devastated (remember this all happened in the period of a few months) I was determined to keep teaching. I reached out to other local universities and while at first receiving positive interactions some short time would pass and I would get silence or clear no answers. Perplexed but getting busier with my day job and promotions and moving to a new house I continued to wait over a year messaging the new director of my old school waiting to see if I could teach again.  Yesterday I then got an email from the director telling me to take the school off of my LinkedIn as I was no longer employed at the university. Surprised, I said I had just thought that I was waiting to teach again and that I always expected to come back and teach. It then turns out that I had received a separation notice from her with no explanation the year before but that I had moved from the location it was sent to and had not received it. Further one of the staff members told me today that the Dean had been working behind the scenes to make sure I didn\u2019t teach again, all because of my earlier \u201ctransgression\u201c of the LinkedIn profile. \n\nSo yeah. I used to be an adjunct. Anyone looking for a technology focused b-school instructor?",

        "body": "So I\u2019m feeling a bit beaten down. It\u2019s my second year teaching anatomy &amp; physiology at a community college. I was hired fresh out of a PhD program, so I feel like earning respect from students is an uphill battle because of my age/gender.\n\nI guess there\u2019s three questions I want to ask:\n\n\n1. How much resource sharing is normal for departments? I had to pretty much beg for anything shared from other professors and ended up having to make slides/lab activities for two different classes my first semester. This translated to many all-nighters my first year teaching (I\u2019m still exhausted from the first year/PhD).\n\nI can\u2019t even get a clear answer on how closely each professor follows the department-wide textbook, making me feel as if I\u2019m over teaching\u2026 I\u2019ve discussed this with many other faculty, but at this point feel like I\u2019m just wasting other faculty\u2019s time since little has changed and I occasionally get dismissive answers.\n\nSo is this normal? And is there a resource I could use to make sure I\u2019m not \u201cover teaching\u201d despite simplifying the textbook some during lecture?\n\n\n2. How many additional resources do you automatically provide to students? I don\u2019t want to overwhelm them, but they aren\u2019t studying effectively. I provide my lecture slides (which they know I write the test directly from), a review (open ended questions written from lecture slides), optional extra practice homework, and even link YouTube videos/flash games in the LMS. I additionally go over note-taking habits, study tips, and offer tutoring before/after class and in office hours. I never plan in-person formal reviews, but offer to have student led reviews before tests (they ask, I answer reviews). They usually don\u2019t ask questions.\n\nI know that many of them are not putting in the effort. But for those who are trying, what types of resources do you provide? Particularly language learning since many students do not remember the terminology. And how many resources is too many resources?\n\n\n3. My last question: Do you think if students will \u201cget better\u201d in the future? I have many students that I love talking with. They are interested in the subjected and would succeed in anything they chose to. Most of the students lack resilience. They might ask for help, I tell them come to office hours/stay after class then they ghost me. Social media, cell phones, and COVID has seemed to significantly set back students. So do you think it will get better? Or will students continue panic at a single low grade and have such short attention spans they can\u2019t sit through an hour lecture?\n\n\nThank you for the read. I just am still feeling set up for failure. I\u2019ve seen significant improvement in my course material/teaching which has yet to translate to significant changes in class-outcomes.",

Today I met with my class and we co-created the second half of the semester. They suggested topics they want to learn about that fit under the theme of the course. We mapped two assignments that they thought would be fun and meaningful. We discussed some potential readings. I nudged them in certain directions so as to cover topics I already have readings for but mostly gave them control. They are already a good group but I think having that ownership will add a bit more energy to the back half of the course. \n\nIt is probably important to note that these are seniors.",

        "body": "OK...another ChatGPT/AI post. What kind of assessment tools can be used in the AI era for an asynchronous online class?\n\nBackground: I teach online intro level environmental science and chemistry courses, mainly for adult learners/ nonmajors so the content level is already pretty basic and easy to look up (\"what is an igneous rock?\"). I have already spent huge amounts of time rewording textbook problems and testbank questions so they are not easy to look up on Chegg and the like. Or, I assign problems with randomized variables, fake compound names, images, etc..  But there are limits to this as well, and even so I find some of these questions turn up online. \n\nNow with AI, all that effort to make questions un-googleable has gone out the window.  What kind of assessment tools can be employed on an introductory, asynchronous online class, ideally something that can be reused a few years in a row and not spend time rewriting everything?  I was considering going the lockdown browser route (have shied away from requiring this so far, as they are pretty invasive on student's privacy, and can still be artfully gamed, anything else that can be done?  Don't really have time for oral exams, which a colleague suggested.",

I zone out during meetings even when trying to pay attention. I teach creative writing. I don't publish research. I feel lost. Nobody else in our department wanted to serve on this committee, so I was basically chosen to do so since each department needs a representative for this committee. \n\n\\- Equality committee.

It's assumed that I'll want to take on every LGBTQ+ event, educational session, etc. I know this is important work, but I'm not super passionate about it. I'm a lesbian, but that's not my entire identity. I feel like the committee would be better served if they found someone who actually felt passionate about these events and informational sessions. \n\n  \nThe two above committees necessitate a lot of time and energy, so I can't exactly get rid of them without cutting into  my service hours. It sucks because my publications are numerous. I'm all set with publications. I'm also set when it comes to teaching. Student evals are always top-notch.

Students have found it to be a fun and worthwhile experience. Now that things have calmed down, I've decided to re-introduce debates. It's a pretty small class size.\n\nIn the past, I've picked the topic. This time around, I figured I'd have students come up with a list of topics and then we would vote. I also came up with a few topics. Most of the proposed topics were what I was expecting -- marijuana legalization, abortion, school uniforms, animal testing, etc. \n\nI received two, however, that might be problematic. They appeared on the same sheet, and I can't tell who the student is. Here are the two topics as they were written:\n\n1. Women shouldn't be allowed to put their babies up for adoption.\n2. There are only two genders\n\nI don't think students will pick either of these topics, but I feel like even proposing gender identity as a debate topic opens me up to a whole bunch of problems. At the same time, if I leave the student's topics out, he or she might then accuse me of dismissing them due to their beliefs. As for the adoption topic, I'm not even sure that's a debate topic. I mean, wtf?   \n\n\nHow do I approach this?",

I also had a minor in Latinx Studies and a certificate in Civic Engagement. Post-college I did a 6 month certificate in Data science through a coding boot camp.\n\nBoth of my parents are immigrants from Mexico and did not have a college degree. It was really difficult for me to be a first gen / low income college student but I made it through thanks to a good support system.\n\nI\u2019m currently teaching high school math. I previously worked as a research analyst at a policy nonprofit. I really like teaching, mentoring, and doing community work.\n\nWhen I was in college, I knew some graduate students that went straight from undergrad into a PhD program \u2014 they said that they got their masters after about the first two years of the program. To me this sounded nice because I know that as a PhD student you get paid (albeit a small amount), whereas a masters degree can be expensive ($20-$30k is what i\u2019ve heard).\n\nI would like to enter into a PhD program in Interdisciplinary Learning and Teaching, but it says their minimum degree requirement is a masters. They have a Masters I\u2019m interested in called Learning, Design, and Technology. However, I\u2019m worried about the cost. They say they offer financial aid but I worry that it is just in the form of loans. \n\nI guess my question is what was your path like to becoming a professor and did it involve taking out loans? What was it like living off of the PhD stipend? \n\nI feel that I would enjoy the life of a professor. I\u2019m just not sure how long I should stay in teaching (which doesn\u2019t pay a lot but better than a PhD student)  and how best to prepare myself for graduate school.",

        "body": "So, last week I sent out some TT applications to places that I actually would like to live/teach, but really just to test the waters to see how competitive I am in the overall market. \n\nThis week, I received an invitation for an *in person* interview asap. Haven't even done a phone or zoom preliminary interview yet. \n\nThis uni was on the top of my list of applications. However, I feel that one of two things is happening:\n\n1. They really *really* want me (great!)\n2. They already did other on campus interviews and know who they want for the position, and just need my interview to fill a quota for the search. (not great)\n\nI'm still relatively \"young\" in my academic career, and so haven't had the opportunity to be on the other side of the selection committee. So those of you who have, is this a good sign, bad sign, or no sign?\n\nEither way, I'm glad I have a job currently and do enjoy teaching at my current institution. I just would like to spread my wings a bit and get more experience.",

I teach a math-heavy engineering course, so the assignment would consist of giving them an equation that they'd have to use to do a bunch of related calculations.\n\nWhat's holding me back is knowing that there are students with friends in the class, and knowing that they'll \"divide and conquer\" the work - \"ok, you take part A, I'll do part B,\" etc. This (1) doesn't accomplish the goal of testing their knowledge in a non-exam-anxiety-inducing environment, and also (2) isn't fair to all the students who don't know anyone in the class and have to do way more work for the same credit.\n\nIs there any way around this conundrum that anyone has come up with? I don't want to withhold an EC opportunity from everyone just because some people might abuse the offer, so I'd love to structure it in such a way to work around the issue, if possible. I teach \\~200 students, so giving everyone different assignments isn't really feasible, and I'd like to avoid making it timed (IE through the LMS), since I know a lot of students freak out about time crunches.\n\nOf course, another worry I have is that they'll be focusing on the extra credit assignment (IE last unit's material, which won't really come back this semester) instead of focusing on current topics, thus potentially leading them to do poorly on the next exam, so maybe this isn't a good idea in general?\n\nI'm pretty new to teaching so I'd love to hear from some more experienced professors!",

        "body": "Hi, \n\nQuestion for the group... Can my university continue to use my teaching materials after I leave?\n\nI'm teaching music production courses a private university in Colorado. I may be leaving the school after this academic year because my low pay (averaging less than 1% raise every year on top of low base salary) + travel expenses (90m drive) are becoming too prohibitive to make it worth the commute. Over the past 4 years, I've created a whole series of video tutorials for Ableton Live that we host privately on our music department Vimeo channel. The videos are embedded into canvas and pair with different assignments. Students are assigned to watch 1-2 videos per evening.\n\nThere are probably around 30-40 videos I've created all ranging from 30-60 minutes which do the \"teaching\" and then in-class we go over questions, demonstrations, exercises. My videos are essentially asynchronous lectures where I show students how to get started in Ableton, use synthesizers, mix their projects, etc. I should say I'm a staff member (technical director of the music department) and I co-teach these classes with our Associate Professor of Music Technology. I'm listed as an instructor on the syllabus and I help with every aspect of class except grading. If I leave later this year, the Professor will continue to run these classes and it would actually be a ton of work for him &amp; the department to \"re-shoot\" this much video content so I assume they'd try to continue using my content. The videos are screen recording me working in Ableton but also have my face in the corner and me talking the entire time.\n\nI'm asking now to get ahead of this. Plus I'm still being asked to create new tutorials still.\n\nDoes that content belong to me, or the school? Should I ask them to stop using it when/if I leave? Could I use this content for my own private purposes once I leave (online course, or a YouTube channel, or something?)\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "Hello fellow professors! I'm at my wit's end with a student. He is the neediest student I have ever taught and the most disruptive. I have asked him to come meet me during office hours tomorrow but I honestly don't know what to say to him. All semester he has been popping into my office hours weekly without fail, without making an appointment (I usually don't require appts because students rarely abuse my open door policy), he also regularly pops into my OTHER class that he is not enrolled in, or waits outside the door for me to come out of the classroom. All of that to either ask me to \"check\" his work, or answer questions about the directions (which he never reads beforehand), or ask about any other number of things that he can find using any of the dozens of resources he has for class. This is JUST OUTSIDE of class. IN THE CLASSROOM he constantly interrupts me to ask a question, make some statement, or complain. It drives me crazy and I've tried shutting it down every which way I can think of. He never brings his supplies to class, and is on his phone the majority of the classtime. It is a studio art class, and he complains constantly. He keeps complaining about how much work they have to do, the fact that they have to \"read\" in an art class and that it's \"hard\". He'll say things like, \"This is a beginning art class?\" All of this is done in front of all the other students. I always respond with something like, \"this is a college course and yes it is challenging but this is why you have x, y, and z resources\". I've spoken with some of my other students in the class and he is bothering them as much as me, besides the fact that he's so needy he monopolizes my time very aggressively and doesn't allow me to help other students as I should be able to. I tried to re-establish boundaries last week, by telling him I was not going to \"pre-grade\" work as he was waiting for me outside my first class. Then in class I kept shutting down his interrupting me and the other students. Oh yes, he also interrupts other students in class constantly. He got defensive then, and so when I asked him to answer a question or contribute he said \"no i'm not going to answer because you didn't let me speak before\". Anyway, he got pouty, totally shut down and played on his phone. After the 2nd time I asked him to put his phone away and pay attention to the midterm review he collected his things and walked out of class. I was in such a rage at that point I let him go and marked him absent. But now I have to speak with him and tell him that his behavior is unacceptable and we need to turn this ship around. The wildest thing is that he does good work, he just needs constant validation and attention, and his seeking it is disruptive. He's not being disruptive because he wants to be a jerk, it seems to be all anxiety based. I'm so frustrated, any advice on what to say to this student?\n\nAlso, my chair has been informed. But she's not very helpful right now because she's got too much going on. There was an offer from her to sit in on the meeting though, so she's supportive.",

Instead, basically tell them what they want to hear and as long as they get their degree with the least possible effort, everyone is happy. Every time I do challenge them, there is pushback, every time I do hold them accountable, someone takes to rate my professor, and telling the whole world that I\u2019m mean and unreasonable.  \nHow can teach with integrity in such a corrupt system? Values seem fundamentally misaligned. What should I do? How do you navigate - or at least come to terms - with this?",

Any criticisms are also welcome but would appreciate the reasoning and perhaps a proposed solution.",

        "body": "Whether it is a gender thing, an age thing, an approachability thing, or some combination of the three, I am dealing with a significant uptick in student trauma dumping. It affects me in significant ways that can impede my work. \n\nIt started during the pandemic when everyone's mental health took a downturn, but it has not yet slowed or stopped. I get stories of death, assault, suicidality, parental abuse, other forms of domestic violence, &amp; general existential crises. I am a very empathetic and sensitive person with a traumatic past, so I have poor boundaries when it comes to these situations. I end up overextending myself to help them because I know that university &amp; in-town resources are strapped. I end up in tears or as a quaking ball of anxiety and helplessness more often than not, &amp; not only does it affect my doctoral research and teaching duties, I am starting to feel empathy fatigue creep in. \n\nI know that my student's \\[mental\\] health problems are not my responsibility &amp; I know that sometimes all I can do is recommend they reach out to professionals. However, knowing this has so far been insufficient in helping me deal with my own emotions.\n\nI do have a therapist, so I am looking for coping strategies from colleagues that a therapist might not be privy to &amp; to start a general discussion on trauma dumping and emotional labor in teaching. The support I am looking for is coping skills for dealing with emotional burnout &amp; advice on phrasing so that I can gently but firmly hold emotional boundaries around trauma dumping. I do not want students to stop talking to me; often, they tell me that I am the only adult in their life that they can trust &amp; I would never be able to live with myself if I took that from them. However, I need to take care of myself.\n\nHow do you deal with trauma dumping coupled with the fact that professional resources on &amp; off campus are often inadequate?",

I am so exhausted and burned out.\n\nDue to several factors (super remote location, trying to avoid going off the enrollment cliff, and the fact that I am the only person on my CC\u2019s multiple campuses who is qualified to teach what I teach, and more), almost all my biology classes are hybrid classes. Lecture is in person (or a combo of in person and via Zoom) and labs are done \u201conline.\u201d\n\nThe labs are about to end me. When I knew this arrangement was coming, I selected a lab manual that I could supplement with videos, and I chose one that does allow students some hands-on activities at home. It\u2019s not an ideal situation for biology courses, obviously, but it\u2019s what I came up with and marks all the boxes as far as meeting state requirements and department objectives.\n\nI have more than 200 students. They have about 15 labs per semester - basically one a week. Some of those labs are 8-10 pages long. I cannot keep up with the grading. I am working 16-18 hours a day just trying to survive the lecture part of my classes. I allow myself to take Saturdays off because my mental health is about to give out. I have what feels like a million labs to grade because I am super behind and I don\u2019t know what to do with them. \n\nAbout a quarter of my students\u2019 final grade will come from lab. They have two lab exams (in person with proctors). Their lecture grade comes from a couple of exams and one reading quiz per chapter. The lecture stuff autogrades in our LMS.\n\nHow would you all grade the labs? Completion only? Spot check? There is a review section at the end of each lab. I thought about grading that only, but some of my department objectives require me to indicate how many students complete each lab. Is doing the review enough to count for completion (completion is not defined)?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about using spring break to recreate the review sections in our LMS so they will autograde. If students mess around and do not complete the actual labs, they won\u2019t pass the lab exams. For most, that will be incentive to do the labs. I hope. That takes me back to: is that enough to cover completion?\n\nI feel sick. It\u2019s Sunday and I am going to be working until at least 2 a.m. like I do each week. I\u2019ll start out my week even more exhausted and burned out. It\u2019s making me a shitty professor. I don\u2019t have anything left to give.",

        "body": "Context: Students in my research methods class had a semester-long research project. They got to choose which project they wanted to be on from about a dozen choices, and if there were more than 5 per topic I made two groups so everyone got their first choice project. One student always arrives to class early (via zoom) and is chatty and self-deprecating but charming, but constantly sharing that they're overworked and exhausted due to 19 credit hours to try and graduate this spring. This is not as uncommon in the class as the student would like to think, since the class is only juniors and seniors and it's required for the major. \n\n**Timeline** \n\nJanuary 9: Semester starts. Syllabus agreement requires students to sign off on the class policies for late work, grace periods, etc. \n\nClass policy is: All assignments except midterm and final exams get an automatic 3-hour grace period from due date/time to allow for those (not un-)unexpected \"my laptop broke!\" \"internet is being wonky!\" \"the power went out!\" reasons for turning assignments in the next morning. This 3 hour grace period is times so that if something happens right before the deadline you have an hour with ITS still open to help you troubleshoot over the phone, and then 2 hours to get yourself to campus (this is a small town, so getting there from the farthest part still only 30 minutes if you walk or about 5 minutes to drive from anywhere) so you can use a lab computer to turn in your work before the end of the grace period. You get 3 free 48-hour extensions that you can use on anything except those two exams; you just need to submit the pass through canvas before the deadline by (so they won't email me to spill their guts out and beg for it). Outside of these options, late work will not be accepted. \n\nJanuary - February: The student blows off a handful of small assignments during the term, keeps telling me in class how sorry they are. \n\nMid-February: Student's team asked to speak to me about the student, who's not contributing anything to the group work. I tell them it's up to them to decide what to do based on their team contract. They can either kick the student out of the group, or they can keep them and just plan to work around their lack of participation and give low markings on the team evaluations. They opt for the latter (foolish team). \n\nEnd of February: Student sends a long long email to me and other professors about how sorry they are for underperforming because of the aforementioned 19 credit load, but really I'm better than this, I promise to do better, etc. \n\nMarch 3 morning class, proposal deadline is at 9pm, last day before spring break: Team members let me know that the student contributed nothing to either the proposal or the in-class presentation, and that they had just contacted one of them that day to get the link to the shared proposal document, as the student had not opened the proposal document at all since it had been started a few weeks earlier. In class I remind people that I will not be responding to last-day emails, to use the 48 hour pass if they need more time, etc. \n\nMarch 3, 6:30 pm: Students emails me directly. When I see their name pop up on the phone notification, I guess what's coming, so even though I said I wouldn't respond to emails, I open it on laptop. Subject line does not disappoint: \"Flood power outage\" with 4 image attachments. Yes, it was raining, but not hard, and I checked the local power company (the city) and no outages were reported as being in progress. Open the email. His bottom floor apartment is in danger of flooding! Here are pictures to prove I'm having to put tshirts over the windows! My power is out! I can't possibly turn in the paper! Etc. Of course, the proposal is in our campus 365 cloud, and it could be submitted via the iphone being used to send the email, but that would require the proposal to be done. To be clear, the lit review and method section were being done by the whole group, with only the 1-page introduction requiring individual work. The rest of the proposal had been completed without him, so he could have just written two paragraphs and submitted it. I replied that he should submit the free pass by 9pm to get a 48-hour extension per the syllabus, and that emailing me like this was inappropriate. \n\nMarch 3, 9:01 pm: No free pass submitted by student. \n\nMarch 4, 12:01 am: In case the student got confused and thought they had until the end of the grace period, but no, still no free pass. 12:02am -- 0 on proposal. \n\nI would take bets on how long it will be before I get another email telling me how impossible it was to do anything on the 3rd (or the 4th, etc) and why I should let them turn it in a week late, but I don't have the money to cover the bets. :)",

Many of these students failed this class last semester, so they are forced to take it again. Majority are on academic probation. I get that COVID screwed with this current group of freshman, but dear God I hate my job so much right now.  I just want to teach the material. I don\u2019t want to answer your emails you send me at 8pm on a weekend because you can\u2019t be bothered to visit me during office hours or to look for answers to your questions in the syllabus. \n\nMost of these students aren\u2019t going to finish college.

I will start by mentioning the key things that I learned about and need to be aware of from now on. The full time faculty even admitted that she realized it was clear that I was thrown into this dual enrolled course with incomplete information. In other words, they are taking responsibility for what I am about to mention in the next two points.\n\n1.) My course was classified as hybrid in the course listings despite all in-person lectures. I listed this on the syllabus, but it should not have been hybrid all along since the high school required instructors at my community college to do all in person instruction. I never violated that agreement I was not aware of the entire time, but I should ***not*** have received a master course shell that was hybrid in the first place. The same applies to the hybrid master syllabus as well. I have changed my syllabus classification and re-submitted it in the database.\n\n2.) As I thought, it was the assignments that were the issue the whole time. I am now required to follow the assignments that this full time faculty member made previously and should receive them for my upcoming lectures. They are a mix of in class and written assignments that will be nothing like what I had before. I made sure that she and the others knew that I never changed any assignments like they though.\n\nNow, what will change in my course:\n\n1.) No more comments \n\nI was told that I should not leave any comments that explain a particular grade, despite doing so in every other online class I taught up until this point to pre-emptively address student questions about why they got a certain grade. I was specifically told that mine made them feel like they lost confidence or could not approach me at all. I am certain that I told them that the comments did not reflect my feelings or that they should feel a particular way since they were \"blunt\" for the sake of expediting grading and giving them some scaffolding for future assignments.\n\nOne student even complained that I took off half a point when they did not indent the paragraph. The full-time faculty member told me that I should not approach it like I am their \"English teacher.\"\n\n2.) Mix of in class and written assignments without prompts written by me.\n\n3.) This is one I came up with on my own, but I want to have a way for students to express their feedback in an anonymous, safe manner. The fact that complaints raged on about my course for just under 2 months and I did not know they were a thing until recently frustrates me. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle this? On the one hand, I feel really bad that students felt like I was not approachable. On the other, I am frustrated that this much talk about what was \"wrong\" about my course went on behind the scenes for as long as it did, only to surface so suddenly after it reached the Dean himself.",

I\u2019m trying to decide if I should entertain the idea and would really appreciate thoughts and input. Here is some context\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m tenured at an R1 and I primarily focus on research. Last year I almost left because of the terrible post-award support for grants. Although I got two strong offers from other R1s, I didn\u2019t leave because I got a generous retention offer. Additionally a new chair came on (who I like) and a new person was hired to fix the post award support issue (I\u2019m not the only one who complained). It\u2019s been about a year, no major improvements but I know it takes time.\n\nMy former chair is now at higher ranked R1 that is about triple the size with substantially more support for research (probably due to a much stronger model to keep cash flow going). She knows the problems at my current institution and has described in detail how much better it is at her new institution. I really want to go because of that but I also I am pretty sure I could get a strong package. \n\nHowever, I am a single parent of a child in elementary school. I also have health problems. I am scared to leave for a place where I have no support system in case I have to be hospitalized unexpectedly. I also know my child would be devastated to move away from his friends (but he\u2019s a very social kid and I know he\u2019d make new friends quickly). However, the new R1 is in a state with a better public school system and is overall much better aligned with my values/beliefs (politically speaking). I shared my hesitation about moving with my former chair and she said I could work fully remote. That\u2019s an appealing option (especially given I work fully remote now and like it).\n\nThe other major con is that I\u2019d lose tenure. I could reapply and get it there but the actual $ is worth less there (I currently have a guarantee coverage of 50% of my salary whereas there it\u2019d be about 50% of the average faculty salary which would be roughly $50k less than mine annually). \n\nThe last major con is just how much work it is to move institutions - learning new systems/policies, learning new people and politics, etc.\n\nI asked two of my long-term mentors what to do and they both encouraged me to go because they know my former chair well and like her plus they know the new institution has a much strong infrastructure.\n\nI\u2019m so torn on what to do. I kind of want to go visit for some informational interviews but am scared to be wooed.  It\u2019s the age old academic conundrum - if it was just me, I\u2019d go, but because of my kiddo (and health) I\u2019m scared.",

I\u2019m not authorized to physically search them for obvious reasons. \n\nOne student asked to go and i accompanied her there and she gave me a concerned look when she saw I was following behind her. I just peeked in the bathroom to see if there is someone else there that she may be meeting to share questions/answers with etc. \n\nBut anyways, i would NEVER ask a prof to go to the bathroom during an exam, especially in a short exam, that\u2019s very suspicious even if the intent isn\u2019t to cheat. \n\nThis is Canada by the way.

If they are an \"average\" player, is that \"average\" according to Major League Baseball - where they'd still be in the top 1% of baseball players regardless of their standing on an individual team - or average according to all professional baseball, minor league included - or average according to all people who have ever held a bat? And what should the baseball degree program strive to produce: an MLB-qualified player or a general professional player?)\n\nI'd also love to hear specific examples of average work within the individual classes or field if sharing it isn't giving away too much information about your field.",

Personal connections?  Placement service?  Just contacting/applying places?

Same old story: the deadline was on the syllabus from before the term even started, it\u2019s on one of those Canvas features that collates a personalized calendar of assignments and due dates for each student, and over the last two and a half weeks, I opened every. single. lecture checking in with the class asking how everyone was feeling about the project and inviting questions about it. Predictably, the extension requests start coming in the day before the deadline. Fine, all normal, everyone\u2019s really sick or suddenly had to travel home for an unspecified family emergency. Whatever. I tend to grant these requests anyway within reason.\n\nBut then - and I suppose, in hindsight, this has been part of a larger trend the last year or so - the *demands* for extensions start coming in. Not the ones simply asking for an extension because of this or that reason, but the ones actually *criticizing* the timing of the deadline, the difficulty of the project, or the coverage of my own lectures to help \u201cprepare us to succeed.\u201d (As far as I can tell, the student is upset that you can\u2019t simply regurgitate what I said in lecture in order to complete the project. Not unpredictably, I have also *never* seen this student in lecture.) The ones claiming to speak for the entire rest of the class because \u201cI have a lot of friends in the class so I know I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this.\u201d\n\nWhere is the world is this shamelessness coming from? Times like this I just have this deep urge to go all \u201cdo you know who I am\u201d on all my students. Like literally every other university professor at a research university, I\u2019ve found my little research niche in my field, and in that niche I\u2019m pretty accomplished. Again, like everyone else here. I put a lot of care and effort into my classes (current rant not representative of how I feel about teaching all the time). Does it just never occur to them how privileged they are to be taking an intro course in a subject that the instructor is actually an expert in, a subject to which the instructor is contributing new knowledge through their research? Again, I don\u2019t have a Nobel prize or anything (not even close!) but even if I did I feel like it wouldn\u2019t even occur to these students to care, and they\u2019d feel just as at liberty to patronize me about how it\u2019s my fault they can\u2019t do a good job on their midterm projects in time.",

I have a decent amount of latitude with regards to assignment structure, rubrics, and deadlines. The first assignment was due at the end of the fourth week of classes. It wasn't particularly long or challenging, but due to a slew of new students joining the class right before the add/drop deadline (week 3), I decided to push back the assignment due date two days, from Friday to Sunday. I thought this would make everyone's lives a bit easier - students who joined the class late would get a couple extra days to catch up on lectures before doing their first assignment, I wouldn't be inundated with requests to extend the deadline on a case-by-case basis, and the students who already completed the assignment would get to enjoy their weekend without worrying about the assignment.\n\nInstead, I woke up the next day to no less than 5 (five) students posting on Piazza, asking if they can get extra credit for turning the assignment in on time, or asking if they can apply their unused extension to a future assignment, and saying it \"wasn't fair\" to those who did their assignment on time. One even complained that they lost income from their job because they had to sacrifice work hours to do the assignment. All this for an assignment that was meant to be completed in 2-3 hours and they had 4 weeks to finish!\n\nAnother story: a couple semesters ago, I TA'd a different class. The professor was very, very nice, and I think the students really took advantage of his good faith. One of the programming assignments was due close to the midterm, so he pushed its due date to the following Monday. Of course several students immediately proceeded to claim that the new due date was too close to the due date of the following assignment, so that one should be pushed back too. For the rest of the semester, there were requests on Piazza to extend the deadline for pretty much every single assignment, most of which were granted.\n\nHave students always been like this? I swear, I'm not that much older than these students (part of my undergrad was impacted by the pandemic too), but their attitudes towards learning just seem so drastically different than mine and my peers'. When a professor gave you a deadline, you met it, or you accepted a late penalty. If you were given a difficult assignment, you went to office hours to ask for help on how to get started, not to try to negotiate a modification to make the assignment easier. I remember on my first day of APUSH in high school, our teacher assigned us a full chapter of textbook reading with a quiz on that material the very next class period. And you know what? We all did it. I just can't imagine today's college students showing that amount of grit.\n\nAs a sidenote, I've noticed several professors' Rate My Professor rankings have absolutely tanked in the past couple years. I have to wonder, did their teaching get that much worse, or have students' expectations for workload and difficulty changed drastically?",

        "body": "So I am like 1.5 years into my faculty position at an R2 school. Got R01 and want to move to a bigger school. I have excellent colleagues and chair and I'll miss them.  Yet, I think it is better if I move to an R1 institution. I was wondering about a few things. I am going on the job market this fall and hoping I'll get a more positive response this time compared to 2020.\n\n1. When should I tell the chair? I am hoping to start at new place in Fall 2024, if I get a position.\n\n2. I have a startup and I'm wondering if they will limit my spending after they know I am leaving? I am already planning to not spend much and only use whatever is really necessary to continue to run the lab.\n\n3.  If I get a recommendation letter (should I even ask?) from my current colleagues, will it be viewed more positively by the hiring committee, then say a letter by my collaborators? I'll definitely get letters from PhD/postdoc advisors.\n\n4. Should I talk to PO and ask to delay R01 start date until I am at my new place? it can be tricky because I am not sure if I'll get a faculty position at R1. \n\n5. It is feeling awkward and I am feeling a bit guilty too. I am really thankful to this school that gave me the opportunity. not sure how to overcome my guilt (besides not leaving!)\n\nAny thoughts will be super helpful. Thanks!",

It\u2019s a multi-discipline department with the P&amp;T committee being composed of all tenured profs for Assistant Prof reviews and all of the full professors for the Associate Prof reviews. This is problematic for a variety of reasons, but predominantly because 1) it creates a huge amount of work to review everyone, 2) because it\u2019s so onerous people tend not to fully review the cases, and 3) the largest discipline is quite different than the two smaller disciplines (grad program, teaching load, supervision, etc) leading to numerous conflicts over the years related to different expectations. (I agreed to chair this committee because these meetings have honestly been the worst part of my almost 20 years since tenure). \n\nWe\u2019d like to change things up and will be likely be considered a pilot for the college, so hoping to hear how others do things.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear how other universities handle P&amp;T. For example, if you have a P&amp;T committee that is composed of a subset of tenured faculty in the department, how big is the committee, how is membership determined, how long is the term? I\u2019m particularly interested to hear from for those of you in multi-disciplinary departments. Do you have separate P&amp;T by discipline? \n\nAs a follow up, who presents the cases? Is the review letter written by the committee or the department chair?",

Is this just a carry over from Zoom High? Am I just an asshole for making them earn their points for lab instead of just giving them points for warming a seat?\n\nMoaning about exams I can understand since there are a lot of points at stake, but folks are melting down over a literal handful of points for showing they've actually learned something in the lab, literally moments after spending the entire period going over those things with their lab partners.\n\nMaybe I'm just a hardass who enjoys a challenge, and not everyone is like that, but goddamn, I couldn't imagine getting so wound up over something like then when I was an undergrad.",

I had the first interview last week and thought that my teaching demo went well, but was genuinely concerned that I did very poorly during the interview portion. \n\nI must have done better than I thought, because I was pleasantly surprised today to receive an email inviting me to the second interview in a few weeks.\n\nHowever, my concern comes from their request for references. I'm to include 3 references, and it must include one previous supervisor or manager and one current supervisor or manager. I'm asking a few separate people and I'm not concerned about most of them outside of trying to determine who my best selections would be. However, I have not told my current manager about this position, let alone that I was applying anywhere at all. I'm currently a learning and development specialist for a different university and my manager in that role is very passive, aggressive and very much a micromanager. \n\nI don't really have any kind of supervision for my adjunct faculty role that I can include, so I feel like using the manager for my full-time role is my only option. However, I'm not really sure how to broach this with her, let alone whether she'll be positive when giving the recommendation. Overall, I'm a wonderful employee, but because of the way that she manages, we did have a small disagreement recently and I'm concerned about how she'll represent me as a result. For context, I had to take one of my cats into the vet and stayed late that day to make up for the time difference, but she was very upset that I had not gotten her permission to do so ahead of time despite the fact that I was not actively training and we had no meetings nor any other items that would have conflicted with my schedule.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to best navigate the situation? This is truly my dream job and where I want to work and eventually retire. So I want to do everything in my power to make this happen.",

The first check, I was admittedly too lenient with dictionary copying...I focused more on content (e.g., sentence and definition do not match).\n\nI was also been lenient with dictionary copying if the students are trying their best--e.g., I can tell that they're writing a majority of definitions/sentences in their own words.\n\nI have one-two students who, for this check, have likely copied every single definition and sentence from the dictionary. (I won't accuse them of plagiarism just yet, but at the bare minimum, the writing doesn't match their usual style.)\n\nI plan to take these students aside privately, ask them about it in a non-accusatory way, and give them a chance to rewrite their sentences. However, I'd be open to other suggestions and how to address dictionary copying--especially as it isn't an essay source.

        "body": "How do you overcome this? I understand that lectures can be boring, but when I have activities in class, there's a decent number who just won't do the activity. If I ask students to prepare by reading something or watching a video, most won't do it, so I end up having to lecture anyway. We really don't need anymore assessments, so I don't want to make everything graded. It is worth mentioning that the 20-25% of students I have who are super interested in learning are engaged no matter what we do (and I'm so thankful for them!), but I don't know how to reach the rest when lectures are boring but anything else is too much effort. Thoughts? (Maybe worth noting this is STEM so there are things like formulas/equations etc.)",

        "body": "Every department has professors that quietly tell students where they can download the PDF of the textbook (wink wink).  Sometimes they brazenly post entire chapters, or the entire book, to the LMS. \n\nMaybe you think this will make you the \"cool\" professor and make students like you. Maybe you legitimately think that you are sticking it to the big publishing companies.  Maybe you are (quite rightfully) concerned about the cost.  \n\nThis needs to stop.  For a few reasons:\n\n1.  This practice sets unreasonable expectations.  When professors do this, students start expecting it in all classes.  The rest of the department has to hear \"but Dr. so-and-so gave us the PDF of the book!\"  Professors who expect students to buy books, even cheap ones, get complaints in the evaluations because students think that it's the professor's responsibility to provide the book like it was in high school.  \n\n2.  This practice creates a culture where intellectual property is not valued.  If you copy a textbook without permission, how can you then complain when a student copies someone's lab report without permission?  It's obviously a different situation, but to them, the principle is the same.  Don't expect students to act ethically or responsibly after you set a bad example. \n\n3.  It raises the prices for honest students.  As sales go down, publishers have to increase the prices to cover their costs. \n\nI know it is bad to complain without offering solutions, so let me suggest some legitimate ways to keep textbook costs down. \n\n1.  Use open source books.  They have improved significantly over the years.  If you last checked 5 years ago and didn't find anything suitable, check again.  Ask your librarian for assistance with this. \n\n2.  Allow students to use the previous edition. If the 5th edition is $100 new and $80 used, the 4th edition is probably $20 on Amazon or eBay.  \n\n3.  Avoid online homework systems.  If possible, use the money the students are paying for the access code to hire a TA to grade their homework instead. This is better for the students, usually cheaper, and provides a campus job as well.",

        "body": "Has anyone had to change how they measured students\u2019 engagement mid-semester because the class was exhibiting poor participation and preparation? \n\nI structured the class where it is primarily lectures with in-class activities. Some in-class activities were graded (such as participating in a lab) towards their finale grade and others were not. I have noticed that students\u2019 disregard for class rules has increased as the semester progressed. Primarily, students are constantly on the electronics (even though the PowerPoints are uploaded for them), and it\u2019s evident they are engaged in other activities because when I ask questions they continue to type, smile while looking at their electronics, and some blatantly use their phones for texting.\n\nI have a handful of students who require accommodations such as using assistive technology in class and not being called upon unless the student independently raises their hand for participation. So I opted to allow everyone to use technology for note taking and have refrained from calling on people because I don\u2019t want others to wonder why I\u2019m calling on one set of students but not the others. \n\nYet, at this point, I am wanting to incorporate activities that increase class preparation and class engagement. I have identified several through group work. Those activities are not on the syllabus, but they will be completed in-class. I\u2019m just tired of being met with blank stares when I attempt to engage them in a discussion. \n\nI am unsure how to go about informing students that we will utilize a certain activity on a weekly basis to test their comprehension of the material, yet the in-class activity will not count towards their final grade. This semester I did not do class participation as part of their final grade. So now I am wondering what would be the best way to incorporate a weekly in-class activity  aimed to increase class preparation and engagement without feeling like it will add extra work on the students without the reward of a grade. \n\nClearly, asking reflective questions is not working because I am met with silence, stares, or not even eye contact from some students. If I get an answer, it is always from the same three students. So, if you have addressed lack of class preparation and engagement mid-semester before by making changes to the way the class is structured, I would like your advice. I will preface by saying I am a novice and am still learning the art of teaching.",

The Master's student has accepted a PhD position, the postbac is about to. One of the undergrads is interviewing and doing well at it and has just received their first offer.\n\nThe other one ... not as much. The student didn't tell me they would be applying at all, until I got a letter request in my inbox. They applied to an absolutely bananacrackers breadth of programs, including a bunch that they lack the skillset for. They must have spent 500-700 bucks on applications, about half of which were going to be immediate rejections. I didn't see application materials before they were submitted, and they weren't very good.\n\nI'm not going to lie - I was a little mad that they did this without any communication with me. A few of these PIs, I would consider close colleagues, and it was embarrassing for them to get half-baked application materials from one of my students. I sat this student down and insisted that they write down all the programs to which they had or were planning to apply. That they provide this information to me is in my lab manual and guidelines document. While they did that, I marked up their cover letters with things to change and noted where they should customize for different labs. We had a talk about how I can't help if I don't know what they're doing. And I let them know that I felt personally slighted because this reflected on my training of them. I told them I needed to be looped in on applications and interviews so I can help them prepare and make sure they're putting their best foot forward.\n\nFast forward to this morning. I'm in my office, working on catching up with grades when my friend calls me. They want to chat about how my student's interview went. Record scratch. What interview? The student had told me they would miss a lab meeting for a trip. Apparently the trip *was a PhD interview and they completely blew it. \"*Ditched recruiting events on campus\" blew it. \"Skipped lab dinners and a party at the PI's home\" blew it. \n\nI had a meeting with them scheduled for the afternoon anyway so I just waited. I asked why they hadn't told me they were interviewing. Didn't know why they should tell me. I reminded them it's in the lab guidelines document to tell me about these things. I reminded them of our previous conversation. Met with a shrug. So I told them that they had skipped key recruiting events, and this negatively impacted the perception the lab had of them. That I would have explained how interviews worked, we would have practiced common questions, if only I had known! Apparently, they thought everything was sort of *a la carte* on an interview. They're mortified; now they see why it was my business. \n\nI just needed to vent this. This student was never a great student. I think they should do a Master's before pulling the PhD trigger.  But I still would have been happy to help them set achievable goals and to accomplish those goals if only they had let me!",

        "body": "This hiring cycle I applied to a number of faculty positions (I'm currently a faculty member but looking to move to a better university and/or better location). So far, I have received 5 campus interview invitations, turned down one (I don't like the university and location much), already scheduled two, and working on the schedules for the other two. The problem is these interviews can be back to back (like returning from one late Wednesday and fly out to the next early Thursday), are quite far from my place (flying East-West in the US, taking 7-8 hours each way), and I still have to teach my classes and other responsibilities. These locations, however, are not far from each other. Currently, the two already scheduled are 4 days apart. I can either squeeze one in between (it will be tiresome) or try to negotiate to spread them out. I'd appreciate any advice on this matter.\n\nAnother question: let's say I have interviews at locations A &amp; B, not far from each other, and already had a round-trip ticket between my location and A purchased (by university A), can I fly to A for the interview, abandon the return flight and ask B to purchase a flight ticket from A (not my home) to B then return to my home (not A)?  Will it look bad to A and B if I do that?\n\nP.S.: for my current position, I had only 2 campus interviews at the time that were days apart, so this was not an issue (and I was a postdoc at the time, with no kids).",

In recent years, I've found more and more students convinced that they are excellent and that grades less than excellent are unacceptable (and when these grades happen, an emotional crisis erupts).  My U defines 80+ as \"excellent\", 70s as \"good\", and 60s as \"fair\" (not \"awful\"). Why is having a \"fair\" understanding of course material unacceptable?

        "title": "To the student crying in the bathroom: You are going to be okay.",
        "body": "I feel like I only post here about strange interactions I have with students that aren't even in my classes.\n\nI teach English as a Second Language at two different community colleges. These classes tend to be between two and half to four and a half hours long depending on the class. Needless to say, I like to have a ten minute break or two to give my students and myself a breather. \n\nI also take a fun list of medications that cause a mix of chronic dry mouth and chronically needing to pee like a racehorse after ingesting any water. \n\nI was teaching a three hour class on one of my school's lesser populated satellite campuses this morning. We took our ten minute break and I immediately went to take my irregularly scheduled Niagara Falls of a piss. \n\nWhile I admired the sound of my own rushing brook, someone else came into the bathroom.\n\nAnd she was fucking **sobbing**. \n\nI come out to start washing my hands, and there is a young woman having a full-on crying breakdown. She couldn't even make it to a stall and go all in. She was just trying to use the shitty tear-off paper towels to dry her tears when they wouldn't stop coming.\n\nI am an immensely awkward person. But I do have empathy. So just washing my hands and leaving without saying anything would probably just be the worst experience ever for both of us. \n\nBut, I am also a huge idiot sometimes, so my comment while washing my hands was something in the vein of, \"So how's it going?\"\n\nShe just starts crying harder. I didn't want to just awkwardly bolt or not wash my hands. But, more than that, this young woman is sobbing at 10 a.m. in the bathroom. This isn't a regular cry. This is a ***big cry.*** She is going through it. \n\nMy regular teacher brain just flies out the window. I have washed and dried my hands. All I can say is, \"Do... do you need a hug?\"\n\nThis poor kid nods emphatically and falls into my arms. I give her some solid back-pats and tell her that she's going to be okay. \n\nAfter a bit she breaks the hug. She tells me that she's upset because she's struggling in her class. She \"really sucks\" at the subject but she's hovering at 69% when she needs a 70%. No excuses besides her feeling like she couldn't do makeup work because there was always more she had to do. She's obviously trying, but overwhelmed. I know she was being honest because I am not her teacher and she didn't know I was a professor. \n\nBy the way, this is not meant to sling shade on her professor. I have absolutely NO IDEA what this girl (or the quality of her work) is like in class. Honestly, I would assume it's not good. And if the professor is giving you opportunities to amend work you did poorly on, that's a forgiving professor.  \n\nBut I also remember being type A in high school and undergrad and crying about a bad test grade that probably wouldn't even touch my GPA. Turns out I didn't need that 4.0 to work at a community college. But this is what I like doing. \n\nSo this woman unloaded on me and she got another hug and back-pat. I told her that she was trying. She could ask about extensions if that wasn't outlined in the syllabus. And even if everything turns to shit, one bad grade is not actually the end of the world. \n\nBut I also didn't really offer sage advice in the best way because I had spent two to three minutes of my ten minute break peeing and had to get back to class. I did not know that I would suddenly be possessed by the spirit of a drunk woman in a club bathroom; eager to become a therapist while disregarding my small space and available time frame. \n\nI went back to class. Taught some shit about count and noncount nouns and quantifiers. But to that student crying in the bathroom: You're gonna be okay.",

He is defiant and does not follow instructions given at the beginning of class unless specifically asked to after I notice he didn\u2019t follow through. He has argued about course policies and has asked multiple times to submit a late assignment that is now closed (there are a certain number of dropped homeworks but he used them all.) He sent an email essentially saying he doesn\u2019t think the policy matters and will not take no for an answer. The email\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t appropriate. He seems to get defensive and it\u2019s like he totally forgets the classroom policies when class is over. I can\u2019t explain it but something about his demeanor really concerns me, though I am very neutral and project confidence in my interactions with him. I have been feeling really put off by everything and here\u2019s where I messed up: I learned in the local paper that he was arrested for violating a restraining order. Now my anxiety is telling me he will hurt me or come to class with the intent to if I don\u2019t do what he wants. I feel like I am being bullied and harassed but I feel like I can\u2019t say anything about the local paper report because I am not sure if it is legal for me to know that info or even have it be a concern of mine as my response should just be limited to the classroom. I can\u2019t sleep. I already contacted my chair but am waiting to hear back. What would you do?",

        "body": "Hi there, fellow professors!\n\nDo staff at universities have formal offer letters or contracts?\n\nI recently started a tenure-track job, and I'm asking about staff hiring since my spouse just got a verbal job offer for an 'Associate Director' job at a center at the same university. We are so relieved and happy.\n\nOn the phone today, he talked with the Director about salary and start date etc, so I think it's all good to go.... But should we be waiting for/asking for some kind of written confirmation of the job? He asked to start late March because of wanting to tie things up at his current part-time work, so I guess I'd feel better if there were something in writing, just so that nothing goes sideways in the next month?They arleady called references before the verbal offer, and now they will have him do the various fingerprint and background checks required by the state. But from his chat with the Director today, he is under the impression that there isn't any formal contract until he just starts the job and begins to get paid.  I've only had academic jobs where we did sign a letter so maybe staff hiring is different.... but this seems weird to me to have nothing  at all in writing.\n\nWhat's normal?",

Its in a setting I like but a region of the US I don't \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI accepted the Harvard postdoc last year, and they were kind enough to defer it for a year so I could handle some personal things at home. I worked hard to get this postdoc and I would like to see it through.\n\nHowever, my PhD advisor (who pushed me to apply for TT jobs even though I have the postdoc lined up) is afraid that by the time I finish at Harvard, it will be even harder for me to find a TT position as colleges continue to contract and I'm no longer a shiny new PhD. She thinks I should take the TT offer while it is on the table. The TT position doesn't have any flexibility to let me postpone the start date. The entire point of me doing the postdoc was to improve my CV to help me get a TT position, so I can see the point of skipping the postdoc to go straight to the TT job. An R1 is what I am looking for, and the city its in is great. However, I'm a 1st gen student who went to state schools. I feel like I would never forgive myself if I turned down an opportunity to be at Harvard. \n\nThoughts? Other things I should be considering?",

        "body": "For context, I am a part-time instructor with an M.A. at an R2 institution. I have been teaching for about two years at this point, and I'm well aware that with my current credentials and experience, promotion to a higher rank is virtually impossible.\n\nI was recently emailed by the program coordinator that we will be having a number of lecturer candidates give demos in some of the survey courses we teach in the department. As such, I was asked if I would allow one of these prospective faculty to \"take\" one of my classes for a day in order to observe the candidate teach in real-time.\n\nIn order to do this, I was told that I would need to provide the candidate with my own course materials (i.e., the reading(s) I intend to cover that day in class) so that they might prepare a lecture to give to my students during my regular time slot. In this sense, the candidate would act as a kind of guest lecturer, but only so that the department might assess their abilities and aptitudes, and not for the purpose of assisting me or my students in any tangible way.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's assume that I'm content to allow the department to facilitate this. The immediate problem is that I generally teach \"to the exam,\" so it's difficult to suspect that the guest lecturer would be completely successful in covering all of the points required for a truly successful class period. This is especially true, given that many of my questions are of my own design, and based on information that isn't necessarily to be found in the texts themselves. Additionally, I would feel as if I needed to cancel my two remaining classes (the same course but at different times) -- both of which would be unaffected by this situation -- because I would likely have to spend time filling in the gaps that would inevitably be left after the class period in question. We don't really have time for that in any of my classes.\n\nThese practical concerns notwithstanding, I can't help but feel a little blindsided by this suggestion, because, as selfish as the reason may be, I am ultimately being asked to rearrange my own plans in order that someone else might advance their career. Now, this isn't \\*really\\* the problem for me, but I do think it a bit bizarre to expect this of either me or my students, who I'm not sure would be the better for it.\n\nI don't know. Upbraid me all you want for being petulant, but really I'm just wondering what everyone else thinks about this proposition. Also, and more importantly, how do you think I should respond to this email? Thanks.",

        "body": "There's always a point in the semester, usually around this time, where I become consumed with the feeling that I am failing my students, that I should throw up my hands (nay, throw a desk across the room) and say, \"I give up! You're on your own.\"\n\nSix years of teaching experience in higher ed, and I've spent each semester of those six years building the next semester's syllabi in response to the unforeseen audacity of students, combined with some very helpful information I get from course evals and anonymous feedback surveys I send out during the semester to see how the class is going. Each new semester begins with me confidently thinking \"I've got this! I will not fuck this up!\" And every semester, I do. \n\nLike, I'm not getting better at this - I'm getting worse? I am a 27F and I *cannot* connect with my students. They do not understand my instructions. They are always lost. They forget the information the instant they see it. I walk into class feeling blissfully prepared and leave with my hair full of twigs asking \"wtf just happened??\"\n\nAn exemplary perennial event in Freshman Composition:   \nWe spend four weeks writing an Annotated Bibliography IN CLASS. When the final is due, I receive **3 research papers and 2 emails requesting an extension on the research paper.** Like, for the 4517th time, we have not written the research paper yet????? \n\nAddendum to the perennial event:   \nAs we move into the unit where we actually write the research paper, I'm getting into heated arguments with students about why their 2,000-word research paper needs to contain more than 5 paragraphs. Two sections of Freshman Composition absolutely railroaded me over some advice I quoted from a website about writing a \"strong\" thesis statement. \n\nIt feels like my students are constantly explaining to me why I'm wrong, I've got it all wrong, because this is not what they've been taught before so I've got it all wrong. It's no help that my constitution confirms that idea since their arguments can be so asinine I am rendered speechless. Like, the kind of logical acrobatics my students will perform to make it seem like they got one over on me far exceeds the caliber of effort I expect for the actual assignments I give. Dealing with it feels as though I'm reinventing the wheel.\n\nI'm through talking to bro colleagues who still can't comprehend that students only love a *male* instructor to speak to them like a basketball coach\u2014\"Listen up! Here's the play.\" translates to \"She gets aggressive with our class a lot\" on my course evals. I don't even speak to colleagues anymore because these are the responses I consistently receive:\n\n\\- \"Your students are so weird.\"\n\n\\- \"I have never experienced that in my life.\"\n\n\\- \"It's because you're a woman.\"\n\n\\- \"You should try \\[this completely useless in-class activity\\]. Learning outcomes? Pffft, those are bullshit.\"\n\n\\- \"I just show my students a painting every day and have them write about it. It has nothing to do with research writing, but at least they're writing.\"\n\n\\- \"You care too much.\"\n\n\\- \"If they wanted our students to learn anything they wouldn't have hired us to teach them.\"\n\nSo anyway, I feel lonely, guilty, and like I'm failing harder and harder. I stay because I believe in what I do. I can't resist the creative challenge of conveying information and fostering an environment for learning and deeper thinking, but each semester feels increasingly like... I'm doing the opposite??",

The program heavily teaches in grad school. \n\nSituation: I was approached by Dept Head asking to teach one core course in the program in Fall. I gladly accepted (not my first choice, but that\u2019s life)! \nI asked about the other courses availability (my \u201cI\u2019d love to teach courses\u201d) and it seems that two faculty teach them and won\u2019t move from there (I understand, seniority matters). Instead, I was offered to develop and/or co-teach a new undergrad course that\u2019s loosely defined, and out of my expertise, and interests. \n\nI noticed that many courses (including my \u201cloved to\u201d courses) are taught by the teaching faculty (assistant teaching professors, not adjuncts). \n\nHow to approach this? I don\u2019t want to be non collegial but I also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s wise to accept. I just don\u2019t think that developing /co-teaching an undergrad course in my first semester would set me for success for tenure. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve done so far:\nI listed all the courses that align with my expertise and those who don\u2019t but I can give it a try. To add a little, I\u2019m a double minority and wonder if this would be asked to someone different.",

        "body": "So there's a rather obscure offshoot of my research that I've been neglecting for about a decade or so while focused on other things. Recently, I explained it to a group of undergraduates and they were pretty enthusiastic about learning more. I have a topics class coming up, and I'm thinking about having students work on this as a collaborative project for the class.\n\nThe difficulty is, these are all students in a professional program. Very few are planning on going to grad school, and none or almost none are planning on doing a doctoral program.  It's definitely possible that something publishable could come out of this, but I don't think the students are going to be very interested in doing the work of refining this into a publication once the class is over. A couple might want to follow up, but possibly none.\n\nI do undergraduate research projects quite frequently, and often help turn them into publications, but that's in a very different branch of my work, with students who are intending to enter doctoral programs. Developing a publication policy in those situations is pretty easy. \n\nI'm not quite sure what a good policy would be in this situation, where most or possibly all of the students will drop out of the project once the class is over. What ideas do you have?",

He asked if I could give him some typed up notes he could read while away, and I let him know that if he was going to miss, he needed to get notes from someone in class because I don't have notes to give him.\n\nFast-forward to Monday the following week. I was there early, writing a couple of examples on the board to act as the bridge between the previous topic and the new one. He is handed a whole stack of homework he had missed upon entering the room, and his previous quiz which was... less than ideal in the results. I asked how the trip was, and he said \"alright.\" and the class and I had our usual pre-class \"how's your weekend\" convos going, all while I'm writing things out on the board.\n\nRight on the downbeat of class starting, I start into \"So, if we know this \\[end of board example\\] is a \\[Music Theory Topic\\], and this \\[other part of board example\\] is a \\[related music theory topic\\], we can start to see the basis of \\[new theory topic\\].\n\nStudent raises his hand, I gesture toward him, and he enthusiastically says \"What's that?\" to the entire last week's worth of new material. I kindly mention that he should have gotten notes from a classmate and he said that all his previous network weren't in class this semester so he doesn't have anyone to get notes from. I respond with: \"I'm sorry, but even to summarize all of last week into only a brief, 2-minute explainer would not be useful at all. You'll have to do your best to keep up with the knowledge gap.\"\n\nSo many places where things could have corrected..... but it didn't....... \n\nAnyways, just wanted to share a quick funny before heading out to class.",

I have no formal training in education but my students have generally succeeded and the feedback I\u2019ve gotten on recent graduates from industry peers has been positive. \n\nAll that being said, this is a new one for me. I\u2019ve read many other posts here regarding the wave of COVID leniency students coming in. I have had them as well and generally been able to catch them up. I have a student that came the first day and then skipped weeks 2 and 3. The next two sessions he was an hour late. I have attempted to explain the material to him but I could tell immediately he was impossibly behind on base knowledge to take the course. Here is the weird thing though. He keeps coming to class. He hasn\u2019t handed in an assignment all semester. He gets verbally combative when I explain it multiple ways and he doesn\u2019t understand even the most basic procedure in lab. He is using math notation I used in 6th grade. \n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1) Do I continue to burn in class time on this student? This a lab based class and the face to face time is very valuable for the other 12 students. \n\n2) I can see the potential for this kid to get violent. My first time running into that. I learned from my department chair they had some type of disciplinary hearing for him as a result of comments made to a female instructor last semester. Would I talk to campus security about this I guess?\n\n3) I issued an early alert via our online reporting system. This means he gets an email as does his advisor. I also advised the department chair. Is there any other action item here for me? My first impulse is to help him but I\u2019ve never had a student so unwilling/incapable that still came to class during week 5. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I feel bad for the kid in a way. He should\u2019ve never been allowed into this program based on his ability.",

I enjoy it for the most part, even though I'm an environmental degree who is now always indoors (which drives me crazy). \n\nAccording to my Dean, COVID basically completely killed the program and, in order to save it, he agreed to have it switched to fully online - which got rid of the outdoor classroom space that the program was using. I would assume the program was struggling prior to COVID but I can't confirm that. Anyway, we have 15 total students in the program. That's right. Fifteen. I... do not foresee us meeting our recruitment quota unless by some astronomical miracle. The issue is... the department is a department of two full-time faculty. Myself and my Dean. If I leave... I would assume that'll be it for the program. The current students would graduate and then the program would be over. I know that my Dean would a ) be furious and b ) wouldn't be able to continue keeping the program alive by himself. He struggled finding me as an instructor to begin with. \n\nAll that said, we live within 5 minutes of a military base... one that happens to be offering a wildlife position that I probably meet the requirements for... it's similar pay bracket with a possibility of higher pay if I meet the requirements. Plus all the benefits of being able to go on-base - tax-free groceries, cheaper gasoline, etc. It's also screaming job security.\n\nBut the students and the program... Do I abandon it? I'm also the advisor for the program's club. I'd be abandoning the club that I worked so hard to build over the past year. I'm torn because I'm sensing the entire program is a sinking ship and there is an opportunity here that I may not be able to get access to ever again, but also I don't want to abandon my (limited number of) students and plus I've only been here for a year. I do enjoy teaching (for the most part) but also... I am hesitant because I worry about the program dying a painful death and then my not having a job, but also... what if it (miraculously) stays afloat? Leaving would burn a lot of bridges. I'm torn.\n\nOne of my friends suggested taking, if offered, the wildlife job and then staying on at the college as an adjunct. Then I wouldn't be completely abandoning my students but I'd still have job security no matter what happens.\n\nThoughts? Any solutions that I'm not seeing. \n\nI am leaning towards the logical (technically) choice of wildlife position while being an adjunct but I also don't want to abandon my students and the Dean. I put a lot of effort into the program and I don't want to see it fail... but... I also honestly don't see how it'll be permitted to continue when we have less than 20 students in the entire program (unless, again, we have a miracle happen while recruiting).",

        "body": "I give some exams online and I typically prefer a mixture of multiple choice, short answer, essay, and numerical problems. Because of the way that Canvas is designed however, it is pushing me hard into giving only multiple choice questions. Here's why.\n\nFirst, if you want multiple choice questions to have the answers randomized when displayed, you need to use the \"new quiz\" feature, but not \"classic quizzes\" for some reason. This is important below.\n\nIf you give an exam and then discover that your key has an error you can have it regrade questions - but only multiple choice, true/false, or multiple select questions. You cannot regrade numerical questions. Any error in the key means I have to manually regrade each question. With the new quizzes you cannot regrade question by question, the entire exam has to be reloaded student-by-student and you have to scroll through the whole exam to find the question to manually regrade. My class has 116 students.\n\nIf you assign short answer or essay questions and want to grade question-by-question you can't do that in \"new quizzes\" so you have to choose - do you want your multiple choice options randomized or do you want to be able to grade essay answers question-by-question. Also note that if you do use the \"classic quiz\" format to grade question-by-question it only loads them one at a time, you need to load each student's answer separately with a button click and internet load (as opposed to Black Board which would display all the answers to an essay question on a single screen). This makes grading essay answers with consistency more difficult since it's harder to read a series of answers for the same question and keep that question's rubric in your short-term memory.\n\nFaced with these extra hurdles to grading numerical and essay questions imposed by the Canvas LMS, switching to all multiple choice questions would save me hours and hours each semester. I truly feel that students are better served by exams which include numerical and essay questions, but in addition to the inherently longer grading time for these questions, the LMS (i.e., Canvas) further magnifies the discrepancy.",

        "body": "I am currently a postdoc at a European business school. I love my job and my colleagues. More importantly, I get to live with my partner who is a local here. The only downside is the pay and the lack of stability but they told me that in a year there might be an opening for me for the tenure track. My dream job would be to get the TT position here but obviously, there are no guarantees.\n\nI have received an offer to be an assistant prof in a management department at a university in a different country. This new department is nice as well. It will give me security but it might not help me as much if I want to return to the business school environment and be with my partner.\n\nI guess the main problem is that my partner cannot relocate but we are at an age where we want to start a family. But at the same time, it has been my dream to be a prof and I'm afraid that if I reject it, I would not have another chance. It would be great then to hear from people who had been in a similar position.\n\nOptions:\nStay in postdoc and hope for a TT offer\n(+) Be with my partner\n(+) Focus on research\n(-) Underpaid\n(-) Uncertain/risky. If I don't get the TT job in a year, I'm not sure if I can get another TT offer again.\n\nAccept TT offer and move to new country\n(+) Salary boost/stability\n(-) Need to teach more (which might hurt my research if I want to return to business school)\n(-) Need to relocate / do long distance",

        "title": "a big picture analysis of the cumulative anti-education legislation in Florida.",
        "body": "There has been much discussion over Florida as the canary in the coalmine.  I'm concerned that the general discussion misses the forest for the trees.  So, partially to parse it out in my own head, partially to vent, this is my paranoid understanding of the end game for destroying public education in Florida, as a template for the entire country.  My assumption is that SCOTUS won't be concerned. \n\n  Tl/ DR: All the chess pieces are in place and we're all in a position to be purged and replaced by Hillsdale hacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Stack all Boards of Trustees / Board of Education with ideologues. So much so that Steve Bannon was endorsing individual, local school board candidates. \n\n[https://floridapolitics.com/archives/507806-esther-byrd-defender-of-jan-6-rioters-named-to-gov-desantis-board-of-education/](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/507806-esther-byrd-defender-of-jan-6-rioters-named-to-gov-desantis-board-of-education/)\n\n2) Destroy teacher\u2019s unions. I can\u2019t speak to this as far as k12 but for roughly a decade, there have been routine efforts to create hoops for faculty unions to jump through. \n\na. IE, proposed legislation raising % of participating faculty by 5-10% or the union gets decertified if it falls short. \n\nb. Making automatic paycheck deductions for dues illegal\n\n3) Encourage students (or random people completely removed from the institution, much less classroom) to \u201cout\u201d professors for supposed bias.\n\na. Carve out an exception for one party recording (only other exception in FL law? Child molesters)\n\nb. Claim that \u201canything that may make a student feel shame or other bad feelings, or go against their sincerely held beliefs\u201d is to be \u201cavoided.\u201d Slavery, colonialism, Geology, Natural selection, flat earth? \n\nc. Just as in the TX abortion laws, the complainant need not be a direct participant. You can \u201chear\u201d about what a prof said.\n\nd. Contextualize within the bigger picture of \u201cdon\u2019t say gay,\u201d \u201cteachers are groomers,\u201d anything that mentions race / slavery / criminal justice / wealth distribution is CRT, etc/\n\ne. Starting the end of this summer, all syllabi have to be hosted on a public website for review. Who is qualified to do the reviewing? Probably members of your local John Birch Society / Eagle Forum / Citizen\u2019s Council or self-appointed expert taking a break from screaming about CRT at a schoolboard meeting. \n\nf. If you think that this is just for lower grades in K12, that is merely the door being opened. First start off with the hysteric Helen Lovejoy, \u201cWon\u2019t someone think of the children!?!\u201d and that gets the ball rolling. \n\n4) First legislation making the hiring of college / university presidents \u201cblind\u201d \u2013 for their own protection of course. You wouldn\u2019t want their current employers knowing that they are searching for greener pastures, right? This basically means that outside of the board of trustees, no one knows who the new president is until you get an email congratulating the new leader. \n\n5) In the new proposed bill, FACULTY hiring is taken out of faculty and even lower admin hands and placed squarely in the hands of again, the politically appointed Boards of Trustees. The wiki bio for Richard Corcoran is enlightening on that account: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard\\_Corcoran\n\n6) \u201cFaculty should er on the side of caution.\u201d This is the very general and vague guidance \u2013 intentionally \u2013 on how to skirt issues of race, gender, forbidden economic theories, science that contradicts traditional ideas from the bronze age, etc. \n\na. Intentionally vague so that academically arbitrary rulings can be made and to force faculty to cower in fear. \n\nb. Any faculty member accused of some bias on hearsay or unscrupulous recording or vendetta over a grade will have no union protection (see #2) \n\nc. The penalty is to withhold already scarce state funding from the institution until the faculty member is fired\n\nd. To potentially fine the faculty member on top of firing them. \n\n7) Newest legislation states, no courses relying on \u201ctheory\u201d should be taught on the undergraduate level. No classes on race, no classes on gender \u2013 gender studies effectively illegal as a major / minor / course, apparently. \n\na. American History, for example, should reflect the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Being a scholar of History at the illustrious institution of Yale, our Governor forgets that half of the Declaration deviates from Enlightenment ideals to complain about lack of military support in fighting Native Americans. \n\nb. When \u201ceducation\u201d is reduced to \u201cfacts\u201d without any critical approaches to facts, without any context to facts, without any debate over the presentation of facts\u2026 when education, in claiming to be \u201cnon-ideological\u201d defaults to government mandated meanings of facts\u2026 then you are undoubtedly within Totalitarian territory. \n\n8) The end game, or not to be flippant, \u201cfinal solution,\u201d if you will? Since this is, undoubtedly a fascist strategy (though obviously the communists also took the intellectuals / educators out of society and the books out of libraries)\u2026.\n\na. Tenure will be reduced to at-will \u201creview\u201d\n\ni. No union protection\n\nii. Your institution gets fined for sticking up for you\n\niii. Brace yourself for the doxxing and death threats from random purveyors of anger.\n\niv. Maybe a visit from the Proud Boys or some other pseudo-Freikorps auxiliary.\n\nb. But who will fill the void?\n\ni. Who cares? Education will be reduced to a privatized / for profit enterprise but instead of benefiting Pearson and associated textbook pirates, the spoils will accumulate in the vicinity of New Holland / Grand Rapids, MI. \n\nii. Hillsdale College is cranking out the new Civics curriculum for the state of FL. Expect in depth discussions of George Washington, his hatchet and a cherry tree. They will offer the government-approved \n\niii. Graduates of Hillsdale, along with the respected institutions of Falwell / Liberty U,  Robertson / Regent U, Bob Jones / Jones U, and the illustrious Patrick Henry College will undoubtedly be fast tracked into faculty positions vacated after the purges. \n\n9) Oh yeah, and as all university health centers had to turn in any and all \u201canonymized\u201d data on transgender healthcare a couple of weeks ago, the conclusions of that study can be guaranteed to fuel the next legislative session\u2019s rage cycle. The legislature back-peddled on tracking high school athletes\u2019 menstrual cycles. \n\n10) Hopefully my facetious rundown doesn\u2019t contain any egregious mischaracterizations, but to the best of my understanding, this is the barrel of the gun (soon to be carried without license in the phallic-shaped state!) that those of us in K12 and higher ed are facing down.",

I've gotten full marks on all my observations by my higher ed colleagues for teaching, service, and research, so the freight train of criticism was NOT welcome \n\nTop Comments:\n\"He says he has opinions on things but won't tell us his opinions\"\n\"He is very flexible in working with us when we need it, but he shouldn't need flexibility to get things done\"\n\"I expected to learn HOW to do things not how to THINK about doing things\" \n\"He can't figure out the LMS. What kind of freaking professor can't figure out the LMS?\"\n\"He changes things in the syllabus too much like removing assignments and pushing due dates back\"\n\"I really like his examples from the field\" immediately followed by \"I wish he wouldn't share examples from the field\".\n\nWhen they came out, a close colleague walked me through how to look at them from the higher ed viewpoint since I came from teaching K12. She told me, just because they're in college doesn't mean they are here to master things; most of them just want to get a job. Hence, they need FAR more hand holding than I assumed juniors and seniors would. A co-investigator in STEM said, 'I totally forgot to warn you: don't read comments from education majors. They know a little but not enough to effectively evaluate teaching'. \n\nAfter re-reading them, I noticed exactly what they both meant. Only about half of the Likert-type questions were about anything I had any control over. The comments were only criticisms not any kind of useful or even tangentially meaningful feedback. I did take some nuggets of 'Yes, I can work on THAT' but it was 90% bitching.\n\nI'm better now, but much bourbon was had that night. I'm aiming for the target First-semester-worst-semester.",

        "body": "Man this is taxing me.  I thought I'd come here and rant like everyone else is, but with a different take.   \nI don't trust anything anymore.  It's awful and it's causing arrest in my work.  \n\nI love grading essays.  I'm a writing teacher.  It's what I do, it's what I teach, what I research, and like you folks who work in labs, this is our proving ground.  Writing is thinking.  It's exploration.  It's the opportunity for a writer to take a position on something they care about, do research in an area they want to know more about, their contribution to the conversation of whatever field they're engaging.   \n Usually I read an essay and learn something.  Even the struggling essays still bring something to the table - sometimes you can look at a poor writer and at least see how they're trying.\n\nBut now, I'm so biased because I'm implicitly suspicious.  I can't get away from it.  Is that verbose introduction an AI overusing demonstrative pronouns? ( This is... This is also... This is also...) or is it just a young writer who doesn't know better?  Is the introduction taking a tangent because the student is working through the thought process in a draft, or is it an AI adding unnecessary details because it doesn't know better?  \nIt's killing me.  \nThere wass a part of me going into this semester that \"the AI will only go so far\" but am I now critiquing AI writing that the student's just going to tinker with for the next month, or is this essay genuinely their exploration of ideas? The topic is theirs - right?  But is this their thoughts?  If they have no investment, and its just an AI's product, what am I doing with this?  In the pre-AI days, even if they didn't want to write the essay, and the students are just in the room because they have to be (the unfortunate byproduct of required classes), at least THEY did something.  But now?  I just don't know, and it's sapping the drive completely.  I don't want to critique an AI's work.  I don't have the opportunity to sit down with every single student and have a conversation about their projects (there's not enough time- 3 x 20-per-class = 60 students.  160 minutes worth of class time in a week - it would take two weeks of class time just to have a 5min conversation with each student, and I can't lose that time).    \nI'm going back to the grading now, because I have to, but I really think the essay I'm looking at right now is AI-generated.  I'll do it because I have to, but it really hurts.  This isn't what I did so much work for - to teach people how to revise AI-generated essays.  I don't know how to make this prejudice feeling go away.  \nRant over.",

Most of these are from brand new accounts with exactly 1 post karma. Perhaps it's time to create a rule/filter where only people with a certain minimum amount of karma can post.  It doesn't have to be a large number and this is done is several other popular subs to keep down the trolls.\n\nAs for this sub, I understand why my IT department has such a bad attitude toward professors.  My IT department sends fake phishing emails almost every week and makes our system hard to use, but apparently we have a lot of people who click on random bad links... just like here we have people fail to identify trolls or engage with them anyway.  All they want is the attention!\n\nI also understand why so many are worried about ChatGPT.  If one spends any amount of time familiarizing oneself with it, it becomes pretty easy to spot.  I understand the concept of forensic literature better and have tested myself with about an &gt;80% success rate on first read-through of identifying ChatGPT vs. human-written.  But it seems a lot of us have trouble identifying trolls from their language choices so maybe that translates into not seeing language patterns elsewhere.  \n\nFinally, it's frustrating seeing lot of people get upset about posts designed to get people upset.

        "body": "\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's no secret that technology has made our lives easier in many ways. We've got smartphones, smart homes, and even smart cars. But it seems like some folks are using all this technology for some not-so-smart things.\n\nTake college students, for example. These young whippersnappers have access to all kinds of information at their fingertips. And while that might sound like a good thing, it's causing some serious headaches for their professors.\n\nI mean, let's be real here. How can a professor expect to stop a student from cheating when they've got access to ChatGPT? For those of you who don't know, ChatGPT is a language model that can answer pretty much any question you throw at it.\n\nNow, I don't know about you, but when I was in college, we didn't have anything like ChatGPT. We had to rely on our own brains to come up with the answers. And if we didn't know something, we had to go to the library and look it up in a book. Yeah, I know, crazy, right?\n\nBut these days, these college kids can just whip out their smartphones, type in a question, and get an answer from ChatGPT in seconds. And don't even get me started on the kids who wear those smartwatches. They can cheat on a test without even taking their phone out of their pocket!\n\nSo, what's a professor to do? Well, some have started banning smartphones and other electronic devices during exams. But you know what's even better than that? Actually teaching your students something worth knowing so they don't have to cheat in the first place.\n\nLook, I get it. It's tough being a professor these days. You've got all these distractions and technology to compete with. But if you're a good teacher, if you're really passionate about what you do, you'll find a way to engage your students and make them want to learn.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe one day, we'll have a language model that can answer questions about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. But until then, let's focus on teaching our kids how to think for themselves and not just rely on technology to do the work for them.\n\nThank you, and good night!\"",

When data sets I use don\u2019t match what she\u2019s familiar with, she calls out the credibility of the projects I\u2019m presenting to the class as evidence of a concept. We often discuss Oppositional Defiance Disorder in children, but I\u2019m just a bit stunned this person seems unable to practice basic politeness in a classroom setting at that age (mid forties). The class is visibly irritated by her behavior as well. Anyone else dealt with this? My boss and I discussed that there may just be no way she will change these behaviors, and me having to alter the course in a way that allows the class to just get through the next few weeks, and unfortunately I think I agree with her.",

Here I am back again just wanting to share what a 'friend'/colleague shared with me about the timeline of my campus visit and now I am freaking out a little. I know I may be overthinking this to no end, but does it matter when you are called up for a campus visit? When I told her that they set my campus visit for 3 and a half weeks out, her response was, 'I'm sure you aren't the first or the second one, aren't you worried they will already have their mind made up by the time you get there, and that you are being called in merely as a formality?' Ummmm....is that the case?? \n\n1) From the time that the SC contacts you, on average when do campus visits start to get scheduled?\n\n2) Does it matter what order you are called in? Meaning, does it speak to some sort of unofficial list that they have drawn up already? Not that I would know where I stand but if I'm being scheduled for almost 4 weeks out, is that something to be concerned about?\n\n3) I know every institution is different, all searches follow different timelines, but if were to be good news, how long does the SC usually take to meet to make their final choices? If it helps, this is for a Fall position that could potentially have us being uprooted to another end of the country.\n\nI'm sorry if these questions sound banal or idiotic to some of my more experienced colleagues, but as someone who is going through this for the second time (first time in person), all I am doing is overthinking and re-reading between the lines of every email the SC is sending me.\n\nTIA!",

The content included a student's name on the photographed paper. That student had a disability-related accommodation for extra time/low-distraction test setting. \nThe college provides a test proctoring center for just such situations. The exam had been delivered there well in advance with the student's name written in by my colleague - the same name that appeared in the photo on Chegg.\nMy colleague was bereft at the thought that the student had cheated (they had a rapport) and personally investigated the situation at the test proctoring center. The staff insisted that students could not have their phones/ other materials while taking an exam. The room is arranged classroom style with PC screens, so there's poor visibility of the student's work area from the proctor's desk. The staffer was steadfast in their insistence that cheating wasn't possible, but my colleague then produced the photo of the exam and the staffer then conceded that they are understaffed and they couldn't be certain the student didn't have a phone.\n As my colleague related all of this in our staff meeting, others in the meeting started going to the chronology of the events and concluded that Chegg couldn't have posted the photo in the time that the student in the proctoring center had the exam and we realized that someone at the proctoring center was the most likely suspect for the exam being photographed.",

        "body": "Long time lurker, throwaway account for obvious reasons. Details omitted or changed for privacy. \n\nI am tenured, making a good-enough salary, and am of advanced years: leaving for another institution or industry are not options and early retirement is not in the cards.  \n\nMy college's faculty representative - who chose to take on the position, there is no requirement - has yelled at me, shouted, and CRIED AT ME: it feels awful, manipulative. The person is stressed to the max due to their own inability to manage their time. That has been an issue for this person for years: why they decided to take on the college rep.position when ***stressed!*** is their default  mode is a mystery. \n\nThe problem is not just the faculty rep. There is a long history of uncivil, unethical, and manipulative behavior in my small college that is part of a larger institution. Other colleges in the  institution are aware of the dysfunction of mine. We have a well deserved bad reputation. It is an embarrassment. And I feel very much alone and abused. \n\nWe are required to contribute to the college subdivisions for service work. I have retreated to a degree but cannot fully remove myself else I risk bad evaluations. At the same time, the college rep. is making it difficult for me to participate: they recently rescheduled the bi-monthly meetings during a time I teach classes.  I am damned if I do, and damned if I don't: I was yelled at and cried at for saying \"No, I'm not available for that task right now\" when the rep. asked me to take on a specific task, outside of my normal duties. And, I am being sidelined at the same time.\n\nI talked to the union rep. who recommended I keep track of contributions to the college for my records and no longer speak  with the current rep. on the phone or in person but use email exclusively. Done, but now the college rep. is ignoring my emails (which are all focused on college matters). I  asked for a  means of contributing when I won't be at the meetings and made suggestions, and, no response.\n\nDo I just let myself be sidelined while keeping track of my attempts to contribute?  I have the copies of emails that were not responded to as well as many years' worth of unprofessional email messages from many in the department, for instance, last year the rep. wrote in an email, \"You're silencing your colleagues!!\" (the drama is unreal) when I asked for input on a draft document and not to share  it with the larger institution yet because it was in an early form - it would be shared after getting input from my college colleagues. It was my baby, fully; it was an appropriate request.  \n\nIs being ignored, sidelined my new normal? It is awful, and undeserved. Most of my colleagues support the dysfunction and have acted inappropriately to the extreme themselves. \n\nAnyone else is a similar scapegoated position? How have you functioned in such an unhealthy environment?\n\nMy research projects, students, and service work for the larger institution are enjoyable. Thank you in advance for advice. I am so very sad...",

        "body": "Shit happens in life, and that means that sometimes graduate students can't meet their deadlines or come to meetings. I'm fully aware of that, and compared to other graduate advisors I'm quite kind and understanding about the fact my graduate students also have other important things in their lives than writing a dissertation. \n\nBut over the years, I've had a number of graduate students that frustrate me in this respect. What they have in common is that they a) always explain during progress report moments not what they have done, but why they have not done it (yet), b) have seemingly valid excuses for it. Oddly, these are also always the less talented students.\n\nAnd my problem is: every individual child sickness, deceased grandparent, flat tire, or missed flight is possible, so I'm not in a position to doubt them. But if such events happen twice every month, and are supposed to justify why the student is way behind in their progress, it annoys me because I feel that the \\*aggregate\\* of the shit happening is just a bit unlikely. But as said, they are all individually not that unlikely (except once, when a 5th grandparent supposedly died, but even then, someone could have had a step-grandfather or something). \n\nSo this frustrates me because officially, I can't say anything about it, and they have (long series of) justifiable excuses, but in the end the students inevitably ends up having a dissertation that's both late and bad, which of course looks bad for the student, but also reflects badly on me. \n\nAny advice on how to deal with students like this?",

My dean broke the news to me this afternoon. Ironically, she came when I was practicing a mock interview with a tenured friend of mine. I like to think much of my department believes in me as a teacher and colleague, but my dean stated that the pool was quite competitive. I had made it to the final round but was cut from interviews. She said it wasn\u2019t a reflection of my work just that I was competing against a lot of people who had a lot more experience. Surprisingly, she did say that there are likely opportunities for tenure-track in the future based on the way things are headed, which is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard her say something like that. (We do seem to have a fair amount of full-time faculty who don\u2019t come to meetings or even show up to class.) Do you think that could be genuine or am I just getting strung along?

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am a new adjunct at a local community college while I am a doctoral candidate at my current Ph.D program. I recently received an email from the Dean of this college that states that students and the representatives from the high school district where my PSY 101 (Intro Psychology) class is based (I am only teaching dual enrolled students in their high school) have voiced concerns about grading of the course and that it is beyond what should be expected of a PSY 101 class. \n\nFor some context, I obtained this course about a week and a half before I started. My lecture content was solely based on the book given to them and I did not change any quizzes. Assignments were a thing in the syllabus, but I only had names rather than requirements for those assignments. What I did was create my own assignment prompts instead. From this point on, I am barred from \"changing\" them (even though I did not change anything in the first place).\n\nThis is just an inference on my end, but I think students and the district representatives told the administration that my assignment prompts were a concern. I generally had students submit a 1 to 2 page reflection on what they learned that week. Most averages would be a B-C range, which was mostly due to outliers that were generally on the low end that did not follow the prompts at all, seldom followed those prompts, or did not accurately reflect the material covered that week. \n\nMy class has 9 students. I checked the grades for this course and the lowest grades are a C- and C. It was from those students who submitted assignments that did not follow the prompt. Everyone else (7 students) have a B-A in my class. There will be extra credit towards the end of the semester that will bump most students grades up. The full-time instructor who was recently added to my course shell will re-grade them, give me new assignment prompts, and talk to me about \"serving my students equitably.\" \n\nWhat are the implications of this for teaching my class going forward? I am a bit concerned, but mostly confused since no one is in danger of failing this class at all and it is not even halfway through the semester (7/16 weeks).",

What purpose does it serve?\n\nIt's important for a transcript to show the things that a student accomplished but why does it need to show the things they failed to accomplish? When I present a CPA license or actuary exam certificate, it doesn't show how many times I failed. It just shows that I passed.\n\nFor *internal* reasons (institutional research, advising, financial aid), I can see why we want a record of failures, but I can't come up with a good *external* reason - other than tradition - to include it on a transcript.\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't a good reason. I just haven't come up with one. \n\nThoughts?",

My problem is that I have no frame of reference for the recommendation level in the accompanying online form.\n\nThis is a strong, competent student who works hard and deserves to go further... but is at the same time not exactly a prodigy. They had real struggles in the class, and didn't always get the best grades, but put in real effort, and they consistently attended and had highest marks for class engagement and participation (in a class where this was less-than-the-norm).\n\nMy problem is that I have no frame of reference here. I'm asked in the online form to choose among \"Recommend with some reservations,\" \"Recommend,\" and \"Highly Recommend\". I wouldn't choose \"with some reservations,\" but how are ranks like \"recommend\" vs \"highly recommend\" typically viewed? Is \"recommend\" typically considered a fairly weak category, or is this still a reasonably strong recommendation? While I don't want to oversell the student, I don't want to accidentally sabotage or undercut the student by accidentally submitting what could be read as a passive-aggressive non-recommendation. They deserve a recommendation of some sort, but I'm not sure where the thresholds are here.\n\nOr should I just pick one, because the letter itself matters more?",

        "body": "I just know I'll sound like a grumpy prof here, but here goes. \n\nI think the biggest problem with students today is their general lack of *perspective*, their ability to conceptualize experiences outside of their own. Note I don't mean *empathy,* or even *sympathy*, but literally the idea that unfamiliar experiences, perspectives, histories, cultures (and so on) could even possibly exist at all.\n\nA recent example, you ask? Lately, many students, when writing about existential threats in papers, equate the end of *human civilization* with the end of the *physical planet*. I've gotten several papers where students will say something like \"WWIII would result in the end of the planet Earth.\" \n\nNo. No it wouldn't. \n\nOne might think that's just students being imprecise with their wording, but I've also read sentences that clearly indicate such ideas in some king of underlying thought process, like \"global warming continuing would mean that the Earth would no longer be in the solar system.\" As in \"I'm stressing the solar system to emphasize that I'm talking about the physical planet Earth.\"\n\nA student came to my office to discuss law school applications. When I asked about a local school with a respectable program, the student rolled their eyes and said, \"Ah, yes, I've heard about University of Blah.\" Fine enough. But when I asked *what* they had heard about it, they completely floundered and gave a kind of garbled and quiet response, as though they actually didn't understand why they didn't want to go to the school. It was as if the student simply accepted the first things they had heard about it without asking questions, as though there was no more information to glean from even the most basic research. For what would be a major life decision. \n\nSurely I'm biased in favor of my own experiences, like everyone else is (and I remember saying some pretty inane things in college), but I just don't remember myself or other students being so utterly disconnected from the basic concepts of critical thinking: How do you know that you know that thing? Are you sure the thing you're thinking is what's actually happening?\n\nIt's likely not the students' faults themselves, at least not entirely. The echo chamber of today's media landscape clearly inures students to restricted ideological, epistemological (and even, apparently, metaphysical) ecosystems. But one would think that students who grow up in such a landscape might also have devised ways to resist its more troublesome outcomes. \n\nHave they? Is it just students in my school? Do others have different experiences?",

He sat down with a very big smile on his face and pulls a big bottle out of his bag... it was johnny walker black label.. and wanted to talk about his grade ( can we say no tact?). \n\nCertainly you all can see where this was going. in short, I conveyed that he was going to fail because  he was not being responsible for his academic career, or his parents money. his smile dropped .. shoulders slumped... was lost for words for a brief moment and then pulled out a red envelope. It was about the time of Chinese New Year. My wife is from Taiwan and I usually travel back to Taichung once or twice a year to visit family, so Im familiar with the trafitions... but this was certainly different and not traditional... he slapped the envelope on the desk and smiled... paused and asked me to open it up. \n\nCertainly this was incredibly rude and not the normal thing to do. he wanted to gloat.. he wanted to have the upper hand, he wanted to \"save face.\" \n\nI refused and he decided to open the envelope for me.. pulled put and fanned about $800 cash. Any normal human would consider taking the bribe.. i certainly did.. but i packed it back in the envelop and shoved it in his shirt pocket and quietly told him to leave.

        "body": "Hi! I was wondering if anyone had any advice for what community colleges typically ask for when applying to be an adjunct. So far, my teaching experiences have been provided through my being a graduate student and typically the syllabus and class materials provided beforehand, with my needing to teach that material and only provide supplementary activities.\n\nMy PhD program does not fund us over the summer so I am hoping to apply to the local community college. Is there anything they typically ask for or expect off the bat were I to get hired? e.g., a syllabus developed immediately? lecture slides prepared way ahead of time? other expectations I may not be thinking of?\n\nSearching for teaching opportunities externally is very new to me so I appreciate any guidance anyone has. One of the perks of being perpetually in school /s. Thanks!",

        "body": "Hello all, made a throwaway account to seek some advice.\n\nI have recently been invited for a campus visit (yay!) in a Social Science department. The campus visit includes coming in the night before, hotel stay and all of next day will be spent on campus visit. My husband and I had made prior plans to be in the same state where the school is, and we figured we will drive to this town over the weekend. Here are my questions:\n\n1) Would it be weird for me to tell the SC that my husband will be accompanying me since we had prior plans made, anyway? Is this something I would need to tell them. The past two times I had a 'campus visit' it was entirely online, because of COVID, so I'm unsure of the protocol. I know from colleagues that usually the candidate gets picked up and dropped off to the hotel by someone from the department, but is it okay if I tell them that is not needed?\n\n2) All I have been told that its a 'job talk'. I know I have to talk about my expertise on the subject matter, but is it supposed to be more like a talk or a lecture? \n\nThank you for all your inputs on this! And for the more experienced of my colleagues, if you want to share any advice, or warn me of what not to do, during my campus visit, I'd appreciate that too!",

        "body": "So, I gave an exam a couple of weeks ago, and my TA just finished grading it. As it turns out, he pulled two exams because the responses were incredibly similar. Lo and behold, they belonged to the student who was acting shady AF during the exam and their friend sitting next to them.\n\nDuring the exam, another student had a medical emergency, so I had to leave the room unexpectedly for about 5-10 minutes to deal with the situation. It appears that this provided them with an opportunity to copy their  friend's answers word for word on several open-ended questions.\n\nTo top it all off, the girl who cheated had the audacity to come up to me after class today and argue for points on questions that she copied from her friend. And now I have to play Magnum PI, interview both students separately, and give them a chance to respond to my suspicions of misconduct prior to initiating the complaint with the University.   \n\n\nI'm disappointed and frankly disgusted. Why do I feel like I'm the one in trouble here? Just venting I guess.",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nOur main chemistry professor quit during the last week of the fall term, so I ended up teaching gen chem II. I'm normally teach biology and ecology-type courses.\n\nThe semester has been going well. Students seem to like what I'm doing, but I generally overestimate their math skills. We work on problems in class. I'll take them through an example, then have them work a problem. They struggle, but most of them eventually get it with some hints.\n\nBut we had our first exam, which covered 3 chapters from the book. Two of the chapters were math-heavy and one had hardly any. I gave them 6 open ended math problems that I would classify as easy to moderate. The other 10 questions were conceptual and were either multiple choice or short answer. But also on the easy side, IMO. And they've seen each type of problem in their homework. And I gave them a list of equations.\n\nI haven't graded them yet, but it took most of the students longer than the allotted class time (50 min) to finish. And after a quick look-through, some of them were waaaay off base on some problems. Some of that is because I know a few of them have been looking up solutions to their homework instead of doing the problems themselves. \n\nBut I'm also wondering if I'm covering too much for each exam. When I took chemistry as an undergrad, my professor would test us on 3-4 chapters at a time. But maybe that's too much for students who are used to covid-era schooling? \n\nAnd does anyone have any general tips for working on problems in class?",

        "body": "I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. \n\n\\-Going back to work.\n\nThe reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here \u2013 I don\u2019t particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. \n\n\\-We don\u2019t have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.\n\nFrom the pandemic, to the fa\u00e7ade of a \u201creturn to normalcy,\u201d to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nation\u2019s Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years we\u2019ve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. \n\n\\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.\n\nIn the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what they\u2019ve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. \n\nHowever, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised \u201cgrace and flexibility\u201d as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, we\u2019ve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this \u201cgrace and flexibility.\u201d The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to \u201cfigure it out\u201d for what the response will be. We\u2019ve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.\n\nThe university-wide email to faculty told us \u201cYou should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed.\u201d The university response \u2013 Just update your syllabus! \u2013 reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. \n\nThis is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.\n\n\\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest\n\nWith the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time I\u2019ve taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. \n\nStand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising \u2013 when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. \n\nI am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. \n\nI think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US \u2013 particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty \u201cculture\u201d here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more. \n\nThat's pretty much where I am at right now.",

I thought telling wouldn't hurt because i emailed way in advance, so i should be the first to receive the add code, right? nope. prof gives the code to both of my friends and now apparently the class is full and they expects me to \"come on the first day to see what they can do\" which is not very reassuring. honestly i'm really upset by this. i feel like i should have definitely gotten a code first because i emailed much earlier than my peers. also, i don't see any other reason she gave them the code over me- we're all same majors and standings. anyways yea, i'm upset and i will try to come on the first day - but at the same time it's not guaranteed because now i have to choose another class for my open selection time. what should i say? should i say anything at all? it just feels so unfair",

        "body": "One of my biggest pet peeves in recent years has been the pervasive misuse of psychological terms, particularly gaslighting and narcissism/narcissist. This seems to happens mostly within the social media/content creation space. I see countless creators/influencers describing ex-lovers as being narcissists, or comments like \"girl, stop letting him gaslight you\" for incidents that were clearly (at least to someone in the field) NOT gaslighting or narcissism. The term narcissist is especially damaging because people who truly have Narcissistic Personality Disorder are very difficult to spot in the wild. \n\nMy idea was to have students identify a piece of content (youtube video, tiktok, reddit post, ect) where the creator misuses the term and explain in a few paragraphs why they believe this is a good example of misuse (and maybe also provide an alternative explanation for what happened, like lack of communication, misunderstanding, etc). They'd need to include some kind of link to the content so I can check it. But I was also thinking I would add bonus points if the student commented on the content to let the creator know how and why they've misused the term, within polite parameters of course. \n\nThoughts? Is this a terrible idea?",

        "body": "This town where our university sits is extremely car-dependent, and thus, students have had to rely on overpriced food courts and dining halls to eat, especially between classes. Albeit expensive, at least the food court food wasn\u2019t too awful bad. There was some variety.\n\n\nBut the pandemic shut down a lot of the food court, and nothing has ever returned. The building is less than ten years old, but inside is a creepy ghost town now. Sometimes, you find a random student studying in a corner; no doubt a good choice, it\u2019s quieter than the library. The only thing left is a shitty grab-and-go with near-expired food with wilted lettuce (supply chain issues, you see). Also, the card reader is often broken down, so cash only. So students can\u2019t use all those dining points they paid for. \n\n\n\nThe Campus Barnes and Noble bookstore has a cafe, so at least the caffeine addiction can be fed during study sessions. Except it can\u2019t be staffed, so it\u2019s open irregularly, shutting down at random unannounced times \u2014 also, supply chain issues. So, you can go to the cafe when it\u2019s open and it will be a fine experience as long as you don\u2019t want brewed coffee, espresso drinks, tea, or anything with milk in it. But if you want one sad croissant, this place has got you covered.\n\n\n\nThis might be the saddest building on campus. Students with cars can at least travel to the big wide world, but it sucks to be a carless student.\n\n\nDid I mention the dining halls have been accused of serving undercooked meat and moldy food? Also, supply chain issues.",

        "title": "My two cents for a lot of the professors ranting about students in this sub: Structure and Backbone",
        "body": "As I read the rants/vents a lot seem to me to be permutations of the same things that could have been avoided through structure and backbone. I'm not saying don't do the rants/vents. They're cathartic. Shouting out into the internet can help your mental health sometimes. No judgement here. I do it all the time.\n\nI came into academia after 15 years in industry and was pretty shocked with the changes, or at least, my perceived changes now that I was far removed and on the other side. I almost left teaching after my first year out of frustration, but stuck it out. Then, Covid happened and, well, I don't have to tell you how that all went and how it still is reverberating. I have taken lessons from the situation and worked to keep my standards while building in a bit more of equity for students to help them get back on track.\n\nWhen I say structure, I mean your class setup and polices. Students need structure. Most of them are not learning how to learn or being taught how to college. Not giving them that, of course a lot of them are going to \"fail\". And you may think \"that's not my job!\" And to you I say \"BS\". It's in your best interest and the students' best interest for you to address it and honestly it doesn't take a whole lot more effort or whole cloth rewrite of your course. Nor does it take away your standards. In fact, it helps students meet them and makes your life easier.\n\nEvery line in my syllabus and instructions comes out a student not meeting or misinterpreting my expectations or just general college expectations. \n\nYou have to have an attendance policy. That's number one. They signed up for this class at this time. The expectation is they be there. You're not doing them any favors by not having them and thinking it's only about the things you assess for. When a student is in class they benefit from things ranging from being introduced to concepts, being able to ask questions (even if most don't, some do, and all hear the answer), seeing \"good\" students do things to model off of, hearing you riff on your subject/other thoughts, getting immediate feedback, doing a guided activity, etc. And communicate those reasons to the students. Even if some students aren't fully paying attention, there's the 'osmosis factor'. I still give a number of 'free' absences (3, which is 10% of my class periods) because life happens. But I also have an upper limit where they automatically fail the course (8 - 25% of class) unless there's something like hospitalization. In the middle I reduce their final grade logarithmically. Full disclosure, my biggest course only has 60 students with most of my other classes being 20 student workshops. I make the TAs have students sign in to the 60 class.\n\nA lot don't even know how to take notes. Consider skeleton notes. It's a very equitable way to help them take notes. Some can't hear or see as well. Some are a little slower on listening or writing. It also cues a student who doesn't take notes and pay attention to do it and they perceive it as easier as they don't have to frantically write or figure out how to best structure their notes. Don't mistake your capacity and ability to take notes as true for everyone. I require they turn them in. I don't grade based on accuracy, just a checkmark of points if from 30,000 feet they look fine and have all the pages.\n\nProbably the only other really required thing is a late work policy. I take off 10% as soon as it's past due and then 5% each additional 24 hours. I don't accept work later then a week past due. That cuts off any end of the semester BS. I make no exceptions (other than hospitalization).\n\nAnother equitable thing I do is make all things due right at the beginning of a class. None of this midnight BS. Some students actually have terrible internet. You're not paying for it. And some places have terrible internet. By making it due then, they can get to class a couple minutes early and upload to the system. If there's some real 'issue with the LMS', you are there to verify it. If they didn't come in and there was an issue, you just hit them with the late penalty. It's on them. I actually had a student complain to me once about having it due before the class. Which blew my mind. But I told him it's a due date, not a do date, and shared why I do it.\n\nI do offer 1 or 2 72-hour extensions for any exercise in my classes that students can use no questions asked, but they have to shoot me an email telling me they're using it. I generally don't start grading within that time period anyway, so it's no skin off my apple. And, that way they know they only have the 1 or 2. I don't get begging emails. And it makes me look like a star because I build it right in and let them know that I realize they have 5 bosses that don't coordinate. I also track these extensions in the LMS as their own item, so they can see if they have any left. Once they're out, they're out. I'd say about half of any given class uses them. And it causes me no issue.\n\nBut I never give those extensions for larger, multi-week projects. They have to time manage in that case. But what I like to do on these projects is have concrete items that have to be done at various due times or they lose points. I don't want students banging out the whole thing in one night. I break major projects into deliberate smaller deliverables such as research/exploration/ideation/drafts. I make checklists of what those deliverables entail. This, by the way, is how I think more classes will have to work as things like ChatGPT become standard. I also try to build in a peer group critique session if I can. That way students get insight into how others are approaching. I structure those as well by making them use the rubric and some guiding questions as they talk about each others' work.\n\nWhich brings me to rubrics. I never once had a rubric in college. When I got here, students demanded them. And now I love them. It takes as much 'voodoo' out as possible and speeds up grading. It communicates exactly what and to what level I am looking for of various skills. They have cons too, like what I call 'checkmarking' by students where they try to hit those items but somehow the piece as a whole doesn't hold together. But I now have some qualitative items in it to account for that. But, let's face it, grade inflation is what it is...\n\nI will also say, your context means you have to think about what your real expectations can be. I teach all upper class students in my major. I'll admit that I'll tell my students that if push comes to shove, it's my class they should put more time and effort in than their gen eds. I'm sure that will bristle some of you. But, what I'm teaching in a professional program honestly will help their specific goals more. If they can do both well, by all means they should. But I call a spade a spade. I also harp on the fact that grades don't really matter in the real world. Focus on learning. Obviously, that is a bit lost on a lot of them.\n\nIf I taught gen ed, my expectations would be pretty different. Not that gen eds aren't important, but, let's face it, they're less important on the whole to the student than their major classes. Stick to a few objectives like writing and critical thinking. Or how your subject actually relates to their real world and not just knowledge for the sake of knowledge. But accept that most of them are not there because they love the subject and are in any way invested. I floated through a lot of my gen eds, and I bet a lot of you did too. I literally can barely remember any gen eds or my gen ed professors. Nor have I used any specific rote items other than the odd Jeopardy question. What I have used are skills like learning, thinking, argument, writing, etc. I know a lot of the rants are about those very skills. That's why you need to clearly communicate to the students that that is a real goal of the class, don't assume they know it. It might actually make them appreciate it more. Share more about those strategies and a little less about the topic to get them on your page. Not much. It can be as simple as 5\u201310 minutes at the end of a class discussing strategies for what you're asking them to do for assignments or how to study or whatever. Not the instructions, but the meta concepts. They won't remember any of your subject unless you draw a clear line to how it affects their actual lives besides getting a grade to pass.\n\nI also point out constantly how much time any given course should take outside of class. A 3 credit class expects you to work 6 hours outside of class according to my University. I remind them when I assign something. If a student doesn't do the work, I remind them again. If someone complains they 'spend so much time on it' I ask them 'how much time'? Some think a half hour or hour is so much time. I will say 6 seems like a lot and really 5 hours each class and going to the classes is a 40 hour week. I know some have jobs and things, but it is what it is. They chose to be here and their goal is to learn, not just pass through and get a degree for paying for their tuition. They have to carve out the time. I think a bit too many in modern college think it's for socialization and the classes are more an inconvenience from that. You have to tell them they are mistaken. Yes, that matters, but that can't be the focus. Work hard, play hard is fine, but you can't just play hard and forget that first part. Students having to work is a real confounding factor that I feel bad for and part of the systemic issues of our society, but I can't solve everything and sometimes life sucks before it gets better.\n\nAs far as backbone, I'm talking about yours. You are not there to be their friends. A friend will back up your buddy in a bar fight even though they were the one being the a\\*\\*hole. You are there to be their teacher and mentor. A lot of times, that means telling them they're being an a\\*\\*hole. Obviously, you have to say that in a nice way and also teach them how to not be that way. But you have to be fine playing the heavy. You're a full adult. They are not. They are still on the runway to adulthood. Some less far than others. Some will hate you for it. That's kind of your job. I even get a little tickle of excitement when I pass a student in the hallway that I know hates my guts just because I asked them to grow.\n\nYou have to stick to your policies. If you build in that structure and some of that equity I talked about earlier, it's pretty easy to then just look them in they eye and say \"That's the policy. I can't change it for you or I'd have to change it for everyone.\" And you say that to students you both like and don't like. No one is above the policies.\n\nThere will still be jerk students who will trash you on RMP and course evals. Oh well. I've actually stopped reading both. Unless admin calls me in about eval scores, I assume I'm fine. I like to tell people I went into teaching because of the movie Dead Poet's Society. But, when I rewatched it, I realized that not everyone stands on their desk in the end. You can't reach everyone. You can't be liked by everyone. Plus, you know, life isn't a movie. No one is standing on their desk in the first place. Most will not remember you. You probably won't remember most of them. You might not even be more than a blip in their life and vice versa.\n\nI also see \"a few students take all your emotional energy\". And, up until I came to this realization of all I've said, I thought that too. But, these students aren't tying you down and making you feel. You are in control of your emotional energy. I used to brood for the rest of the day when I had a bad interaction with a student or work came in and it wasn't up to my expectations. Now, that I have the structure I feel is both fair to hold my standards and fair to be equitable to students because I really am there to help them, I don't let that happen. I shrug it off because I know I'm in the right. If they are being entitled or selfish, that's not on me. I have no problem looking a student dead in the eye and just telling them \"Listen, I know it's not what you want to hear, but that's the way it is because of my policies, which I believe are more than fair. This matter is closed as far as I'm concerned.\" And showing them the door. Have the memory of a goldfish about these matters. I know it's easier said than done, but put that same emotional energy into the \"good\" students and interactions. And a good student doesn't mean a good grade student, but someone who is engaged and trying. \n\nAnd, yes, some students might try to make some argument about wording in a policy, but I just tell them this isn't constitutional law. It's my intention that matters, not their interpretation. They could have clarified before taking any action. That's on them. It would have to be egregiously ambiguous language for me to concede. But the more I've dealt with things, the more revision I have. And I use the same policies in all my classes to keep it consistent. So that's not likely to happen. Most of the times its because they misremember what you said and didn't bother consulting the written instructions or policy.\n\nAbout accommodations. I feel like they are being handed out like candy. I fully admit that, despite my own mental health issues, I don't put the same respect to ones that are probably from that rather than physical issues. Which I guess is good why they don't tell you what they're for to keep my bias in check. Not that they still don't annoy me. At least at my school, the accommodations are less requirements as suggestions. I tell students that my policies are already built with some equity for people who don't even know they can get accommodations, so they aren't getting double whatever is being asked, such as absences and late work. A couple more at most. And I hold the line at 8 absences as a fail without hospitalization. I already provide all my slides, so that's no issue for me. And if they need notes, I tell them my slides are my notes, which they are. If they need note-taking, remember that skeleton notes thing? You can ask another student to share with them. Anything I feel is unreasonable I have no problem telling them it won't work for me. Hasn't happened much. Some students think they get carte blanche or are retroactive. I tell them they are mistaken. We also have a contract we are supposed to fill out with a student when they share their accommodations. That way it's detailed in writing and signed by both of us. I suggest you do the same.\n\nLastly, students may like to say 'well Professor X let's me do...' Or something about past stuff they used to get away with. And to that I say 'well gas used to cost $2 a gallon until Biden raised the prices.' Just kidding. I don't say that. I'm a socialist liberal who acknowledges the complicated global economy. But I tell them that it doesn't matter as that was a different context and different expectations. I'm not Professor X (first of all, I can walk \u2014is that X-men joke ablest?) and the two have nothing to do with the other. That's not how life works. Requirements can be different in different contexts. \n\nI don't want this to come off holier than thou or for anyone to think I think I'm a paragon of teaching. I know I'm not and I am still constantly learning and evolving. Maybe my context is different than yours. But this is where I'm at after teaching 4/4 for close to a decade, surviving the pandemic, and feeling like I've never been happier with or better at teaching. It was a bumpy road to get here and I still have periods of sadness and frustration. But I thought it might help some of you. Obviously, you're free to not take any of this advice or add more advice below.",

I'm the only junior faculty in my department. This is likely irrational, but I can't help but to feel like I'm failing. This is probably not the reality but I feel shitty when I miss things. \n\nI suppose I'm just venting (been up and anxious about my situation for hours). How are you?",

What's happened:\n\n* Many classrooms will now have laptops for instructors to use. &lt;- This is good.\n* The physical controls have been removed, and now all controls (volume, screen lowering and raising, etc.) are controlled by a proprietary smartphone application. (There's no mention of provisions for instructors who have run out of battery power or simply forgotten their devices.) &lt;- This is bad.\n* All microphones have been removed from the classrooms. &lt;- This is bad.\n* RGB cables will no longer be available in the classrooms. &lt;- This is bad.\n* HDMI will now be the only video connection available. &lt;- This is bad.\n* Lapel microphones will be lent to instructors each semester, but only to full-time faculty. &lt;- This is bad.\n\nMany of my students have new laptops that have only USB-C video output; some have only HDMI-mini (or whatever it's called).\n\nWorst is that most of my first-year students are completely inaudible without microphones, and I am required by the university to grade them on presentations.",

        "body": "I just need to vent. I'm so frustrated by the fact that whenever I look at internal or external grants, they normally say that the funds can't be used as a stipend, but have to go to equipment and other operating costs. \n\nThe reason this makes me so frustrated is because in my discipline our research doesn't require labs and equipment the way that STEM fields do. STEM faculty make double what we do, and grants always seem geared toward paying for tangible items that STEM faculty need instead of giving non-STEM faculty a little bit of money so we can teach less (maybe actually get to research this summer rather than teaching a full load!) and breathe more. \n\nI'm not trying to be critical of my STEM peers and their needs to successfully run their programs and give students the experiences they need, but I'm just so beaten down by the fact that even the small grants I'm looking at don't give me the opportunity to just get paid to do...research. So, instead, I will teach 2-3 classes for the university this summer, do some freelance editing, etc. and have very little time for research and writing. STEM faculty will get grants to do all of these cool things with students that will lead to publications, all while collecting their much larger salary and not feeling a financial hit this summer by not teaching. \n\nThe absence of cost of living increases, the increase in health insurance premiums, and other factors has resulted in me making less than I did ten years ago when I joined this university. I am just so sad and beaten down. I really like the university and understand that with the things that are going on our salaries aren't going to increase any time soon, but when I try to be proactive and find grants for summer to get some some breathing room to simply do research, they normally say the funds aren't to be used for faculty stipends. This basically means that non-STEM folks never get a break and just have to keep teaching, teaching, teaching and finding other freelance work in order to survive.\n\nI don't begrudge my STEM peers their higher salaries, I just wish that the folks creating these grants--whether internal or external--would stop and think about how much harder humanities and social science folks have it with our lower salaries, and give us a chance to take a break from teaching so we can do research.\n\nWe just let go of most of our adjuncts and several instructors due to lower university enrollments overall, but our department is still large, and so are our classes. There will be plenty of classes for me to teach this summer. I just didn't want to teach--I wanted the same break that others get when summer hits and wanted to focus on research. \n\nYou would think that with how little we are paid that grantors would realize we can't just skip teaching summer without it being a significant blow to our finances. We are already such inexpensive faculty to retain: we get paid much less, we don't require much money other than laptops and software, and we teach the bulk of the students in the university. Why can't we get a break? \n\nRant over. I'm just sad and my chest actually hurts thinking of all the projects I could work on if someone just gave me enough money to skip teaching summer. If I didn't teach summers, I would have to donate plasma to survive.",

I've always had great teaching evals... until I came out, and when I say they tanked, I mean they *tanked*. I'm not entirely sure what to do about it all, given that not much has changed in my pedagogy after I came out--I added more antiracist pedagogy, which my field has been emphatically calling for, and I moved to contract grading. The projects, the grading standards, most of the individual lessons are all basically the same.\n\nI'm pretty sure that part of the problem is that, as a publicly and visibly trans woman teaching a student body that's about 80% white engineer-track men, most of whom are from conservative, rural backgrounds, in a rural university, my being trans *in and of itself* is part of the problem, and it's not like antiracist pedagogies are likely to go over well with that crowd. That said, even if it *is* part of the problem,\n\n1. It can't be the *entire* problem, can it?\n2. There has to be *something* that I can do to better connect with my students, right?\n3. [Moving from being perceived to be a man to being seen as myself will affect those numbers](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/17/2/535/4850534), I know, but I also know other trans women scholars who enjoy excellent teaching evals.\n4. My upper-division, majors-only course evals remain high, so I know this is a problem specific to this class/cohort, not my teaching as a whole.\n\nI love teaching and I want to be the best teacher I can for my students. I need to meet them where they are, but I'm struggling to find a way to do so effectively as myself and while answering the disciplinary demands of my profession. And, the worst part here is that I don't know any other transfeminine technical writing scholars whose brains I can pick, only transmasculine ones, and none of them have had to wrestle with problems like this.\n\nSo, uhh... anyone got any ideas about what I can do? And if there are any other transfeminine technical writing scholars out there, I'd *love* to pick your brain(s) for any ideas you might have.",

If there were an academic equivalent to canonization, I'd sign off on it for a lot of them. Even the students who got worse grades/understood less were noticeably trying and did improve over the semester. For emails, they usually even included a salutation!\n\nThe new class this semester though. We're slowly but surely nearing the mid-point, and attendance has nosedived. Despite me even decreasing the amount of homework I give, there's still regularly work skipped. I have to spend class time dealing with a student who, honestly, likely needs therapy and/or to build study skills and a way to respond to stress and uncertainty. I get emails with no salutation, shoddy punctuation (eg ending a question with a period) and the following scenario: I get sent two emails, I reply to both questions in one email. They reply, asking one of their questions again (that I answered _in the email they were replying to_) as well as a question that is answered by the syllabus. When there's an issue, they rarely ask a question about it, they'd seemingly rather leave whatever is broken broken, and then finally cave and bring it up in however many weeks when it finally inconveniences them enough. On the plus side, there are some legitimately bright students and I really like some of them, but on average, there's just so many various issues that aren't even related to the actual learning process.\n\nOn the one hand, I got spoiled by my first, I'll admit it.

Someone in the main office asks if there's anything you need, maybe.\n\nNow, empty offices, less interaction, people stuck in front of computers doing all those things alone that used to require interaction, and they can do them from home. I'm finding it depressing. I suspect we might be happier if we returned to pre-computer pace and level of human interactions (though word-processing is definitely a keeper).\n\nJust wondering what others think.",

        "body": "\nMy question: are the students asking for too much? Am I providing too much/not enough scaffolding? \n\nContext: first year prof. first major assignment of the semester: a 3-day mostly in class project followed by a write-up.\n\nI provided students with\n-verbal instructions in class\n-written instructions\n-written steps to perform analysis\n-a video recording of me demonstrating the analysis and write-up steps (with fake data)\n-a sample partially complete assignment with notes that it is incomplete (and I indicate, IN that sample, and my video, and my in class demo, what sections not complete in my sample. So students need to refer to their instructions to complete these)\n-an in class walk through of the analysis steps (they worked on their own data) and of my sample assignment (again, pointing out the areas they need to complete)\n\nA few students have submitted excellent work, with one or too taking the spirit of the assignment and going above and beyond.\n\nMany of the students left out whole sections of writing. Many of the students had software problems and didn\u2019t submit by the deadline. \n\nWorried that my instructions were somehow unclear, I extended the deadline and asked students to resubmit if they missed steps, and to be sure to include those steps if they haven\u2019t submitted yet.\n\nIn response, students asked for:\nA)indv feedback about current submissions to ask if they need resubmission (I hoped that the general in class feedback, and telling students to go back through the instructions, would accomplish this)\nB) a rubric (the rubric will literally be copy and pasting the instructions into a separate document)\n\nI said I would try to do A, but I don\u2019t want to double my work and pre-grade and re-grade assignments, when students should be verifying themselves that they followed instructions. And I will add B for future assignments, but like I said, it\u2019s just restating the instructions (maybe with point values indicated for each section).\n\nFeeling like a pushover here and that I\u2019m putting much more time into creating these assignments than students are into double checking that they\u2019ve followed instructions :/",

She begged me not to report the incident and was worried about the implications it would have on her family if there was an investigation. She was worried about being unable to continue attending school altogether, if her family received this negatively. \n\nI asked my girlfriend what to do first, as she has experience with Title IX legislation but all she said was that Title IX does a poor job at offering relevant or culturally competent assistant to people that have been victimized- and went continued about cultural betrayal being an especially unique form of trauma. However, she ended up telling me to do whatever I am mandated by my profession to do. I am still at a loss for what to do and don\u2019t want to harm my student. I am also worried for her safety as well. Is there a way I can not report this information and assist my student?",

The curriculum is somewhat interdisciplinary with a majority of STEM courses that also have some social science applications or approaches. I've been updating/tailoring my template CV for a few years and usually just go with the version with my Teaching experiences/roles listed first but now I'm wondering if there are larger scale changes I should make (i.e. listing courses taught up front). \n\nSo, if you've been on a search committee for a teaching role at a SLAC or PUI, what do you like to see on the first few pages of a CV?

Let me be very clear that I am extremely supportive of fellow people with disabilities, and I am generally very happy to make accommodations.\n\nBut... I'm barely getting everything prepped every week as it is, and when I did my planning for this week, I thought I was finally getting to a place where I would be able to manage things and start getting ahead.\n\nAnd then I got notification that a student has registered with disability services and needs a LOT of accommodations that are going to throw one more wrench in my own ability to keep up because I'm going to have to do extra work to provide the accommodations the student needs. \n\nI fully understand that this is part of the job. I'm just overwhelmed and I have no idea how to help this student without hurting myself. I feel like the answer is \"be more prepared before the semester even starts\" but I'm a grad student, this is my first time teaching my own classes, and I didn't get much advance notification that I'd be teaching this semester, so I've been playing catch-up constantly. And having ADHD makes that even harder because if I have a bad day (like today) where my brain just WON'T cooperate, I get even more behind. And I'm scared that this accommodation situation is just one more way I'll end up failing my students after feeling like I've been failing them for a month and a half already because my brain just... can't.\n\nSo, I've reached out to my therapist, and I'm planning on talking to disability services about the situation, and I know there have got to be measures in place to help guide both students AND instructors through situations like this, but I guess I could use advice from fellow neurodivergent professors about how they handle stuff like this and stay sane. I know there have got to be some of us succeeding at this job, or there wouldn't be a whole \"absent-minded professor\" trope.",

I have a private office, I set boundaries about when I am accessible / available in person and via email.  I have extensive organizational systems to try to keep on top of all the tasks required to teach and manage a course.  I have recently requested to only teach 1 prep next year.  I do not have an open door policy.  If students request things verbally, I ask them to send me a follow up email as a reminder.  I only work with one student at a time during office hours.  Teaching lab sections are overwhelming, but I am trying to put in place classroom practices to make it less so.  What am I missing?\n\nI feel like some of these things that I require to function may look bad from other faculty and students.  Like, other professors respond to emails on the weekend or have an open door policy, and by me not being available will hurt my student evaluations.  I feel like I have begrudging support from other faculty members in the department.  Like it has been suggested multiple times that having office hours on Sunday or in the evenings would help with my evals.  I've pushed back, but maybe if I had it as part of an official accommodation it would be easier?  \n\nLast, I'm pre-tenure. I don't think I need an extension, but I was wondering if there are other accommodations I could ask for in the tenure process?  \n\nAlso, it would be great to hear from other faculty who have ADHD in general.  It can be a little isolating. &lt;3",

I hope you can forgive me for what I\u2019ve done, but I hope you also can empathize with me for making a mistake. I can safely say that extending a little gratitude to someone can go a long way. After all, we\u2019ve all been through ups and downs that have made life exponentially hard. I think everyone benefits from kindsss. I\u2019m not expecting you to abandon your classroom expectations for one student, I know that isn\u2019t realistic. But, I am asking you to please grade my assignment, despite the fact it was late. I can proudly say that the anxiety that I\u2019m experiencing from this is taking a toll on me. I\u2019m questioning whether my grade will ever recover from making a mistake. I think the best way to learn is to make mistakes, but if I\u2019m severely punished for making mistakes, how can I have enough courage to learn? I will respect whatever decision you make, but I hope you can keep in mind that me turning in my essay 4 minutes late isn\u2019t indicative of my responsibility, but a mistake.",

        "body": "So, I am an Adjunct currently working on my PhD to one day work as a professor. I have taught several classes and really enjoyed/was successful. In previous classes, I went above and beyond for those students who were not motivated to do the work just so I didn\u2019t have to give them a bad grade. It was exhausting, and unfair to other students!\n\nThis semester, I decided to not work harder than the students. Two weeks ago, they had their first high-stake assignment. A few did an amazing job, most did an average job, but a few got a 60 or below. This was my first time giving anyone a 60 or below on an assignment. It was clear the students didn\u2019t read the instructions for the assignment or the case scenario they were required to use to complete the assignment. Additionally, some students included information that was not in their case scenario, and others just didn\u2019t submit it receiving 0/30 for the assignment. \n\nI know that I\u2019m not responsible for the work they choose to submit (or not submit), but it was very hard for me to give students low grades because they didn\u2019t fully complete the assignment, the information they included was incorrect, or a combination of both. \n\nEmotionally, I am feeling incredibly down and doubting myself. I guess I am only starting my teaching career, but already feel disheartened. How do you all cope?",

        "body": "How many departments have a department policy on late work? I am so tired of colleagues saying they don't accept late work in their syllabi, but then they go ahead and accept late work, and then students keep badgering me to accept their late work because \"Professor so-and-so let me.\" \n\nLet me be clear: I don't care what others do in their classes, but if you are not going to hold firm to your own policy, then change it to fit what you actually do. For example, take a percent off for late work. Or, if you don't want to do that, don't explicitly say you will not accept late work in your syllabus. \n\nThere are two professors in my department who keep ignoring their own syllabi and it is setting an expectation among students that if they badger enough, flirt enough, or email enough that others will throw out their late policies. I scaffold my course expectations AND I review exam questions at the next class meeting, so everything in my classes is set up in a way that I can't have late work straggling in. I shouldn't need to give students these explanations--I just want all of my colleagues to stick to their own syllabi. \n\nWill I come across as a total jerk if I bring this up at a faculty meeting? I don't want people to feel attacked so I was not going to say anyone's names, but I want people to stop stating in their syllabi that they don't accept late work and then turn around and accept it. Every time I have to go back and forth with a student and they conclude with, \"Oh, well Dr. W has that in his syllabus but he always accepts late work,\" this is the part that is aggravating me because their actions are causing me to spend more labor telling students no. \n\nWe have to reply to every student email unless the student is being abusive, so I don't have the luxury of ignoring them.",

Thank you  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Student\n\na) The student has had 3 weeks to work on the project they're asking for a 4 day extension on.\n\nb) My syllabus also states that students with expected absences are responsible for working ahead or taking work with them to meet deadlines (which a family anniversary trip out of town, I would imagine, is something planned in advance or at least sooner than after 9pm the night before travel).\n\nc) They're asking for an extension because they're taking a weekend trip, which combined with the 3 weeks they've had to work on the project shouldn't impact their ability to finish on time.\n\nd) My syllabus also states days/hours I check email, late evening Friday night emails will not be acknowledged until the following business day, just after their trip.\n\nI suppose I'm just venting because they could have planned/worked ahead to meet the deadline, but now it seems they're trying to put the obligation on me to give them extra time. I'm not granting the extension, that said, I'm open to hearing how more seasoned professionals would respond.",

        "title": "Colleague Yells at Students and Teaches Incorrect Material - Would You Get Involved? If so, How Would You?",
        "body": "Hi All,\n\nThis is a new issue for me and I'm unsure how to react appropriately. I teach undergraduate politics courses, but my early background is in anthropology and one of my courses counts for anthropology credit, so I work quite closely with the anthropology department. The anthropology department hired a new professor in September, and I have been hearing concerns about her from the beginning. The complaints started small, things like her accent being quite thick and that her syllabus is incredibly unclear so no one knew how to meet her expectations. That's fine, it was her first few months in a new country, I figured she needed time to adjust.\n\nThings just kept getting worse. The new complaints were things like students getting screamed at for answering questions \"incorrectly\" (in at least 2 of these cases, the students were not wrong but that's besides the point,) or the professor lowering grades in ways that didn't make sense, like a student didn't do a homework assignment so the professor lowered her test grade that had been graded and turned back 3 weeks prior. These things started to become concerning to me, but I didn't know if it was my place to get involved so I focused on comforting the students and aimed to empower them.\n\nMost recently, this professor screamed at a student who I mentor. I was across the hall when this happened so I heard the screaming, but I also asked the student and two classmates what happened and they all said the same thing. The professor asked what the difference between a language and a dialect was, the student answered by providing two examples (American English vs. the King's English and Mexican Spanish vs. Spain's Spanish) and saying the a dialect is a subset of a language that has minor differences in grammar and vocabulary (and provided examples of these differences in English and Spanish.) \n\nThe professor then screamed at her and said \"MEXICAN SPANISH IS JUST SPANISH!!!!!!! IT'S NOT A DIALECT!!\" The student became very confused because that's not what the textbook, intuition, or google says, so she asked why she's wrong. The professor tells her that Mexican Spanish is just an accent. The student brings up how Mexican Spanish says \"shoulder of the road\" and Spain's Spanish doesn't, and Mexican Spanish doesn't use vosotros, so it's a dialect. She also pulled out the definition. The professor continued to scream at her but just kept repeating \"Mexican Spanish is just Spanish!!!! It's an accent!!\"\n\nAnother student asked for an example of a dialect, the professor said AAVE. The original student who got yelled at asked why Mexican Spanish or American English aren't dialects but AAVE is. The professor refused to answer and yelled at the student to \"Get your ass out of my classroom!\"\n\nI had this student in my class right after this incident, so I heard the screaming in real time and then heard about what happened immediately after. I have many concerns at this point. Firstly, yelling at students in most contexts in inexcusable, especially at the volume and anger level that I heard. Forcing a student to leave the classroom for asking questions, even if the questions sound argumentative, is inappropriate. Telling students they're wrong when they aren't and teaching untrue information is in poor taste. Taking points off of test scores weeks after they come back, over things that aren't even weighted in the same way is unacceptable. \n\nIn all my years here, I've never heard so many complaints about a professor. The students have talked to the department head and he always seems very understanding of their complaints but then does nothing. He hasn't sat in on the class to see this first hand, and if he ever had a conversation with her, it did nothing because she's getting worse. I don't want to hurt my relationship with the department head by undermining his decision or going to the dean.  I know I probably shouldn't be so involved because it's not really my business, but hearing the screaming and then seeing my students look so defeated talking about it is making my blood boil. This is a very small private school with under 2,000 students and about 200 professors. It's a very close community. I don't want to start a huge problem without the department head talking to this professor and at least sitting in on her classes, but I also don't want this to get swept under the rug.\n\nWhat would you do here? Encourage the students to take more action themselves? Talk to the department head? Talk to the dean? Do nothing? I know the particular incident portrayed here isn't the worst thing a professor has ever done, and I know students can be argumentative, but I just can't understand how screaming at them is productive. Especially because the students still don't know why she said they were wrong. She just screamed that they were wrong without giving any explanation when they asked. It all seems so unprofessional and unfair to the students who are paying to be taught.",

My virtual interview went very well and we have had email correspondence since, initiated on their end to inform me they are still interested and to acknowledge it\u2019s been a long process.\n\nSo, I am trying to practice patience, but there are a lot of moving parts. This is for a position I would love, and it would entail a move across states with my spouse, our young child, and two dogs. We are homeowners and would intend to sell and buy asap. We would need childcare secured. The position starts fall semester. \n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on me reaching out to request a general timeline of the rest of the search process? I really want this position, so even if the campus interview wasn\u2019t for another month, I will still take it, but my partner and I are craving a sense of our general timeline since so many variables rest on this. \n\nAgain, I applied about six weeks ago and had virtual interview about four weeks ago. They initiated an email two weeks ago to let me know they are still interested. I appreciate their transparency and understand if I should simply wait. On the flip side, if I can get a sense that I\u2019m not a top candidate or being invited for a campus interview, I want to make my peace. \n\nThank you for advice!",

I love the look on students faces when I help them really understand the material and that moment when it all \u201cclicks\u201d! \n\nThere has been hints from my professor of maybe being able to start teaching at my current university this coming Fall semester, but I\u2019m a little hesitant. I have lived here my whole life and I am ready to move with my partner to be near our other family. But with coming right out of a MS program, I\u2019m not sure how difficult it would be to get a job at a different university compared to here where I have a connection. \n\nShould I stay here and begin my career as a lecturer for a couple of years, then look at teaching in our goal location? Or try and get a lecturer role there this fall / go into industry for some experience then try to land a teaching role?",

I was also offered a position at a school ranked near 65. (these are usnews ranking). At the 30-40 schools I would be working on more HCI leaning projects and in the 65 school I would be working on AI leaning projects.\n\nI would like to get into academia after my PhD - and I would like to know your honest opinion. How does the name of the school where you got your PhD factor when applying for academic positions? \n\nI am guessing a lot of people here are on hiring committees. Could you please give me some information? \n\n1. How do you use the ranking/name of the school of applicants? Is there any rubric or fixed \"percentage/weight\" you assign to it?\n\n2. If two applicants with similar publication record apply would you reject the lower ranked person? or, would you call both for interview?\n\n3. What ranking do hiring committees even follow? There seems to be quite a bit of difference between different websites linke USnews and CSrank. In this case, the univ near 40 and 65 are both instead ranked near 50 in CSrank.\n\n4. How much does the topic of my PhD matter? Is AI going to be better than HCI? (I am interested in both of these).\n\n5. Do I even have a shot at TT jobs if I do my PhD at univ ranked between 40 and 70?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for asking so many questions. I am an international and so have limited knowledge about USA institutions.",

Sure, he might not want to say but would be surprised based on his personality, but who knows.\n\nSo the reason I'm infiltrating this subreddit: What should I do?\n\nOf course, I can't make a move in the middle of the semester and put either of us in a bad position. Unless there's obvious mutual interest...? Still probably not as he's tenure track and wouldn't want to jeopardize that. I am graduating this spring and will not be working with the school or in academia in general. Granted I don't find out he's in a relationship, is it appropriate to ask him out after final grades are in or after graduation day? There's a two-week gap between the end of the semester and graduation. No, I don't know if I can wait until after I walk across the stage, and yes, I have it that bad.  \n\nI assume it's fine considering the circumstances, but have any professors on here had a similar situation with a TA? Or did a TA ever take your kindness the wrong way?\n\nI feel ridiculous being so insecure as a 33 year-old woman and feeling like I'm 13 again (adult crushes are so annoying). I just got that gut feeling I can't shake...\n\nThank you in advance for any and all advice!",

It\u2019s strange because I\u2019m only associated with it administratively - my team at the university has some academics who oversee research programs there, and my team collaborates with a few researchers there on more community-based research and outreach. \n\nThe questions I\u2019m not liking are the ones that ask what I read when I\u2019m not reading science, or what my most played artist on Spotify is \u2026 it kinda feels strange for me to just list these things. I just finished a book called Hood Feminism about the failures of white feminism. My most played artists are Godspeed You!

Now I am concerned about the following two projects:\n\n1. Focus group interview: Data related to this project was collected before I joined my current institution. However, the paper has not been published yet.\n\n2. Survey: I joined this project as a collaborator after the collection of the survey data. The paper has already been published.\n\nI am one of the many collaborators in both projects and not PI. I never had access to the raw data from either project. Data was collected from outside the US. Given the nature of these research projects, I think it is safe to assume that the collected data is innocuous.\n\nI am really nervous if I have violated the IRB code and if yes, what could be the consequence.

The end game of the course is they have to write a six paragraph persuasive essay that includes at least two clearly-identified, recent sources from Campus Library. They get several weeks to do it, and it's scaffolded into small, easy, specific steps that they get credit for doing. They also get help announcements, videos, and sample assignments to guide them. They can email me at any time to ask questions, I will meet with them on Zoom, and we have a very good Writing Center that knows all our assignments. \n\nI send them links to campus mental health services, refer those who seem in especially bad shape, and try to work with the others, but... seriously? \n\nSo many students seem so emotionally fragile. I can't help thinking maybe they should be getting therapy or something before continuing on in their degree programs. \n\nAre you seeing an increase in emotional fragility over simple tasks, too?

At this time, there are very few cars in the garage, and not a lot of people pulling in. The garage has a lot of speed bumps, and in general, I'm a careful driver. So a car pulls in behind me and every time I slow down to go over a speed bump, the person behind me starts beeping their horn. In this garage, you have to go to at least the 3rd floor to park as there aren't any parking spots on floors 1 and 2. So by the 2nd floor, this person is just laying on their horn w/o stopping.\n\nFinally, on floor 3, the car zooms past me and drives insanely fast and parks. I park and see that person who was driving like a maniac is a young girl, maybe 18 or 19. She's getting stuff out of her car, and since this takes her a minute, we end up walking at the same time toward the elevator bank/stairway area. My daughter is about this girl's age, and I'm a total mom; so I told her that she needs to be careful, that there could have been someone walking in the garage, and there are cats in the garage. She said, \"Shut the fuck up, old bitch.\" I'm not even that old. And, I look fairly young for my age. And, I was dressed in my yoga clothes since I wasn't working that day. My meeting was a casual meetup with a colleague at the coffee shop on campus.\n\nSo I said, to her, \"I hope to God you are never in one of my classes.\" Then she goes into the stairwell, and so do I because I never use an elevator unless I have to. I'm not afraid of them. I just like to get my steps in. I think she took the stairs to get away from me once she realized I'm a professor that she'd just told to STFU. So she starts running down the stairs screaming, \"Stop following me! Why are you following me?!\" And then, once out of the stairwell, she ran away down the street as if I was stalking her.",

When I\u2019ve voiced concerns, people brush them off or tell me I\u2019m wrong.  I\u2019m feeling increasingly isolated and crazy, but it\u2019s also increasingly apparent that this person is incompetent at the job and covering with lies, distortions, and other manipulations.  They\u2019re also adept at blame shifting and told HR that I am the one bullying them because I no longer talk to them, which is partly true.  I avoid them as much as possible because it exhausts me.\n\nProbably shouldn\u2019t give a lot of details beyond that for privacy purposes, but has anyone seen this before in an academic colleague?  And if so, what\u2019s the best way to handle it?  Is the truth always revealed in time?",

I have an odd question for you.\n\nLike many here, I\u2019m working my way up the career path and hoping very soon to hit the top of it, reaching Full Professor. However, if things go the way I hope, this will be at a point when I\u2019ve still got 25 years or so left of career, so my question is \u2018what next?\u2019. \n\nI\u2019ve been plugging away at this career path for 20 years but when others reach the top, where do they go? Obviously a choice could be academic management or leadership, as Associate Dean or Research Centre Director, but what if I just want to be a regular academic? Sure, my institution has Distinguished/Laureate Professor I could aim for, but are there other goals? What did the rest of you do, if you didn\u2019t want to be Chair or Dean or Provost? :)\n\nApologies, I know this is totally #firstworldproblems, and many here might be adjuncts and thinking \u2018entitled prick\u2019, but hopefully others have some advice? Just seeking some mentoring I guess. Thanks all!",

I just wanted to see if this was normal and curious about where folks draw the line. \n\nFor example he asked me to develop a new course for the program, asking if I'll serve on extra committees, asked me to give a presentation at a program meeting for a program I don't teach in. He's a good guy and I think runs the departmental well, but it's starting to feel more like a corporate boss/supervisor situation rather than a colleague situation and I'm finding it irritating. Our dept. is usually very collegial and laidback so it's been strange to see this leadership style shift from shared decision-making to top-down decision-making over the last couple of years. \n\nMy workload is already *really* heavy with publishing my books and research, a 4/4 load, and university committees and other obligations. So a lot of this stuff just seems like extra work that isn't necessary for me and is unwanted. \n\nI'm guessing the best thing to do is just talk it through with him but maybe this is just a normal relationship to have with a chair. I'm getting close to tenure so I don't want to ruffle any feathers, but on the other hand I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the random extra work on my plate and this top-down style of decision making.",

        "body": "I have a tenure track position at a community college in Michigan. I love what I do, I've been teaching for over fifteen years, but the following situation has become untenable.\n\nThe chair of my department has accused me of dishonesty, has staff \"keeping an eye on me\" while telling them he's not happy with me. He walks by me in the hall, ignores me, then a few minutes later I get an email criticizing me for something. I ask for a follow up or meeting and get no response. He called me \"weak\" as an instructor, then said all of my fellow instructors are also weak. When asked for context he gave me a version of \"figure it out.\"\n\nI am fulfilling all my duties, teaching unpaid workshops on my off days and weekends to better assist the students. I am giving more than 100% to have a significant impact on my students and overall contribution to the department. I sit on committees and developing important relationships with colleagues at the college and our district. I\u2019m also developing a unique program to increase enrollment to provide more hours for our adjunct faculty.\n\nYet, my department chair does not support me. He does not recognize my additional efforts even when brought up. For example, we had a department meeting over Zoom which I was going to have trouble attending due to a pediatrician appointment for my 2yr old. I told him in advance of the meeting and got no response. I had the AirPods in at the appointment to listen and attended anyway out of fear of more criticism. I was criticized anyway for not saying anything during the meeting. \n\nHe has not spoke a word to me since early December. Just cold shoulders, critical emails and criticizing me to the staff. The staff, by the way, pulled me aside and told me that. They want to support me and make sure I succeed and they're warning me that he's not. For example, I had to leave a class 30 minutes early to pick up my son from daycare due to a Covid scare and now he asked the staff to monitor my comings and goings. Again, they are the ones who warned me. \n\nI emailed him the other day wanting to fix it. I acknowledged that we haven't spoken for a while, we're one month into the semester and I had been quite busy, etc. I offered to take him to lunch, catch up etc.\n\nHe immediately turned the lack of communication around and blamed me for it. He doesn't support me, doesn't talk to me, just demands me to \"contribute more\" while not acknowledging anything that I am already doing. I messaged him that I am having a hard time with his negative perception of me. Again, he made it my fault. Now he wants to have a meeting with the Dean. \n\nI know he wasn't happy with me being chosen for the tenure track position. He had another candidate that he preferred. He admitted as much to others. He has never warmed up to me, and now I'm convinced, as a member of my tenure review committee, that he's setting me up to fail. My tenure review mentor agrees that I am being passively abused and wholly unsupported by him. She also admits that she has been treated this way by him in the past and portrays similar behaviors and attitudes towards others.\n\nI already spend so much time away from my young family, but we need this job. I am good at it. I get stellar reviews from students and peers. I live two hours away from the college and I'm there every single day, mostly from 7am to 10pm and giving additional support on weekends when I feel it is necessary for the students and the department. Sometimes I get hotels. Not because of tiredness, but to make better use of time rather than driving. \n\nAll while being diminished and undermined by my chair. I'm sick of playing defense, I need to go on offense to protect my position, career and family. I'm halfway through my five year tenure probationary period and I just can't see this passive abuse changing in any way. I have never encountered such a cold, impersonal, rigid, passive-aggressive narcissist in my entire life.\n\n\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help that last part, but he does tick those boxes.\n\nI need advice. It's burning me out, I have trouble focusing on my work and family. Topping it all of, I experienced my very first panic attack this morning.",

        "title": "\"Requirement\" that seems to infringe upon Academic Freedom",
        "body": "I'm currently suffering through a Curriculum committee meeting, and it was announced that our class syllabi *must* have points as well as percentages for the course. Now, this is the first time I've heard of this, and I've been at this college for several years. But apparently it's required, or at least strongly recommended, by the HLC or our state's Department of Education. I couldn't tell exactly which organization the person who presented this information was referring to. Regardless of external requirements, supposedly it's required by our institution. This is news to me, since my class syllabi have never included points and no one has ever said a word to me about it.\n\nSupposedly, the reason that points are required is because students \"struggle with percentages\". And if your class is on a 1000 point scale, then it's easy to put the points for each category (e.g., exams, quizzes) so that students can track their progress better (I guess? I didn't exactly understand their reasoning). They didn't explicitly state that our class had to be on a 1000 point scale, but they strongly implied that it was the preferred setup.\n\nHere's my thoughts, and why I'm worried it impinges on my Academic Freedom:\n\n1. Students struggle with percentages? Too f\\*ing bad. Percentages aren't calculus-level math, students can learn how they work. Hell, students interact with percentages in their daily lives. For example, if they go to a department store and are shopping a clearance rack where the clothes are 60% off, they can figure out what that means. So why would we believe that students couldn't figure out how percentages work in the context of a college course? Maybe they aren't familiar with weighted averages, but as it happens, that's content I cover in my course, so I'm sure they can figure it out.\n2. I don't have a 1000 point scale. I don't micromanage each assignment/lab/quiz/exam to be worth an even number of points, or even the same number of points. Some assignments are more involved than others, so they should be worth more than others. Most of my assignments don't lend themselves to being worth an even number of points. I don't give multiple choice exams, so each question is worth a different number of points based on the content it covers, and how involved it is. My exams don't add up to exactly 100 points, and I have no interest in trying to make them fit that mold. Also, different exams cover different amounts of content so they are all worth a different number of points. That's why each exam is a separate weighted category - so they all have the same overall weight when calculating the final grade.\n3. Sometimes I make adjustments to my course on the fly. Maybe I add a quiz, or remove a quiz, or try out a new assignment. I've never made any drastic changes, like adding another exam, just minor things based on the progression of my students. I consider it my prerogative as the instructor of the course, as well as a matter of Academic Freedom, to adjust the course as I see fit. Requiring me to state the number of points the class will be worth up front makes changing things much more difficult. \n4. The students don't need to know how many points each category is worth to be able to track their progress in the class. We are required by the college to use the LMS gradebook feature, and I update it at least once a week, usually more frequently. They can see their grade at any time. Plus, the LMS gradebook has a \"What if?\" feature, where students can see what their grade would be if they got a certain grade on future assignments.\n\nI didn't raise my objections in the meeting because it would have led us too far off-topic and it was originally raised as a side note, not an agenda item in and of itself. I don't know that it is a topic I want to raise preemptively, but is something I am willing to push back on if I get called out for not including points in my course syllabi.\n\nAm I off base here? Has anyone else heard of this being a requirement?",

They aren't even pretending to whisper. The rest of the students can barely hear what I'm saying over their conversation. This already annoyed me and I was about to ask them to be quiet when one of the two proceeds to walk up to the front of the room - while I'm lecturing, mind you - and interrupts me mid-sentence. \"I have a question about the upcoming assignment,\" she says.\n\nLike she expects me to stop my lecture to address her specific question right in that moment. While I admit, it threw me off a little bit because she thought this was reasonable, I collected myself and just politely said \"I would be happy to talk after class. I'm giving a lecture at the moment.\"  Note that this was what I said, word for word. She turns red and heads back to her seat. \n\nI can see that she's upset by it, but there's absolutely nothing else I could have done other than literally stop class for her. Internally, I'm thinking \"this is a good learning experience. She will recognize that her behavior was rude and hopefully, won't do it again.\" \n\nFriends, this is not what happened.\n\nInstead, she hangs around after class and rather than asking her question - the one that apparently couldn't wait - instead informs me that she's very upset that I embarrassed her in front of the class. And apparently, I need to be aware of how harsh words like that impact students and their mental health.\n\nSo that's my morning. How's everyone else doing?",

        "body": " \n\nIn the most simple terms:\n\nI am an adjunct professor at a community college. I went into work on Wednesday morning wearing a blouse. I am a fat (but not morbidly obese) woman.\n\nNow let's get into the nitty gritty.\n\nI am currently a plus-sized woman. My breasts match that. They, uh... stand out. I have suffered with eating disorders for most of my life. I was extremely underweight with an A cup for a while. Then I got fat and lost weight and was slim with a C-cup for a while. Then I just got fat again and have a D-cup. I'm not here to listen to your opinions on my weight, but let me tell you now, I am healthier as a fatty than I was as an anorexic.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I have been all different shapes and sizes in my own life. I am a 29 year old woman.\n\nAnd I just got slut-shamed by a stranger for wearing a fucking shirt.\n\nAllow me to fully set the scene.\n\nI walk into the community college. I get there about half an hour before my class because I need to log into the computer and work with the projector and get the sign-in sheet ready. It's a physical sign-in sheet because I teach a small ESL class.\n\nSo I walk into the school. And before I can even go to my classroom, a woman stops me. She looks younger than me. And I will now recreate a conversation from memory with embellishment that is not word for word, but trying to explain the general idea.\n\n\"Oh, wow. You're really going to class like that?\" she said.\n\n\"...yeah? Wait, what?\" I said.\n\n\"Going to an early class with your 'titty shirt 'isn't going to do anything for you. You look like a whore,\"\n\nSo, by the way. We are in community college building at about 7:30 am. And I am wearing a blouse. Okay, maybe it is a little low-cut. You can see the tits. But, like I said before, I am fat and so are my tits.\n\nSo let's continue my recollection of this conversation.\n\nI reply, \"...what?\"\n\nAnd she says something similar to \"Stop flaunting yourself,\" and I think something about finding a man, even though I am already married.\n\nBTW this woman seems to be younger than me. She is also shorter than me and as thick if not fatter than I am.\n\n\"What is the dress code for your class?\" I ask.\n\nI don't let her answer. I'm mad.\n\n\"I'm a professor here. I have to teach a class in a few minutes. I'm sure you have to get to your class too,\"\n\nAs soon as she heard I was a person with authority, she started backing up. Physically. She realized she wasn't harassing a random student and started to run.\n\n\"What class are you in? Who is your professor? I would love to discuss proper attire with them,\" I shouted as they literally (and I mean LITTERALLY) ran away from me.\n\nBy the way. My \"titty shirt\" is a blouse that belonged to my mom before she died. This is an old, dead woman's shirt. Something a 50 year old woman would have worn ten years ago.\n\nBut my tits are just too on-point, I guess. I can wear the ancient blouse of a dead woman and still get called out because my tits are too fantastic. Which somehow affects my teaching?",

In practice I was at a senior level, and very well respected and now I\u2019m treated like a useless intern that is not allowed to have a single thought.\n\nAnyway, I have decided to step down from this position, possibly academia altogether. Which is a shame, because I\u2019m a really good educator, but I can\u2019t deal with this toxic behavior. Life is too short, my family has suffered enough, as I\u2019ve been so absent with them over the last few years due to work.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m struggling in that my Dean is toxic, and verbally abusive to me in private, but in public overly celebrates me to compensate. Although this is a workplace interaction, I\u2019ve been in an abusive relationship, and this pattern is eerily familiar.\n\nI also have incredible fear meeting with my Dean 1 on 1, to the point where I feel like a turtle crawling into my shell anytime I see him. I shake, stumble, and have no confidence left.\n\nI want to report it now, but am on visa, and have kids and need to not have my visa pulled before I decide to leave. Any suggestions on how to deal with this? \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m between a rock and a hard place right now. Maybe I\u2019m posting here more so to look for moral support.\n\nWhen I leave, I intend to fully report the situation and share with colleagues to hopefully prevent someone else from going through the same thing.\n\nBut wow, never thought I would go from award winning, happy designer to crying in the car everyday to/from work, and losing my confidence.",

        "body": "I see so many posts complaining that the students aren't on par with how things were when we were students.\n\nThis may or may not be true. Probably true, but there's also the possibility that we were all excellent students (otherwise, why would we be here?) and possibly ignorant of the sufferings of an \"average student\" back in our time.\n\nWhether true or not, I think that times have changed. Back in the days, 40-hour workweek wasn't a thing. Our grandparents probably went to work 6-7 days a week (a quick Google search says that 40-hour workweek became standard in 1940; mere 50 years earlier in 1890, the average workweek for manufacturing employees came at 100 hours). Now people are discussing flexible work hours, 4 day workweek, etc. Many countries are discussing universal basic income.\n\nThe few smart people have revolutionized the world so much that there is no need for \\*everyone\\* to be productive members of the society anymore. At least in the developed countries, machines have enough productivity to support the people. It's possible that in a few more generations, almost no one will be working, or working very lightly. I can't envision how such a society will work, nor is that the point of this post. \n\nThe point is, that many students will be fine even if they don't excel at university, even if they don't belong in universities. Academia is notoriously slow at adapting to change, because we value the \"old-fashioned hard work.\" I, too, am proud that I worked hard to get to where I am, and it makes me happy to see the few motivated students. However, I think the future could be held up by just the few very smart people. So it could be that our role as professors is to identify the few bright people who are literally the future of our society, and make sure that they're prepared to take up the mantle when the time comes.\n\nAs for the rest, well, shouldn't we be grateful that they're interested enough in our subject that they decided to take this class? As cheesy as it sounds, giving them some inspiration, some reason to appreciate the subject, and to walk away from the class being slightly smarter than they were, with good memories, might end up being our roles.\n\nEven if that future is further away than I think, academia is saturated anyway. We don't need everyone to go into grad school, we don't need everyone to be academics. As long as they retain something from my course, enough that they remember where to look if they need to apply something from my course, I think I would call that a success.",

I teach senior level nursing students. The first day of class I inform them that if they talk while I'm lecturing that I will call them out on it because I have severe ADHD and even medicated it distracts me completely. \n\nEvery single class since the beginning of the semester I've had to ask at least once for a group to stop talking. Last week I'd had enough and threatened to assign them seats if they kept at it. Thankfully that group has been much better. Today is was a different group that was carrying on side conversations with one of them repeatedly showing 2 others their phone. After hoping they'd stop I finally asked them to please stop talking.\nThen I noticed 2 others that seemed to be asleep, and one person in the front row who was on their phone the entire time.\n\nThe icing on the cake was at the end of class. I was on my last slide, the clock in the classroom was off and I thought I had 10 more minutes. Three students just get up a leave taking all of their stuff with them. They weren't quiet about it either. I made a remark about doesn't class end at x time and I proceeded to look at my watch. I discovered I had gone a whole 3 minutes over \ud83d\ude44 I'd rather them have politely informed me of the time, instead they were just rude. \nAnd these are future nurses.

They were terrific--did all the homework, had great things to say in class discussions, just a dream to have. \n\nI saw their name on the roster for one of my online upper level classes this semester and was honestly delighted because they'd been such a great student and I just felt relief that there'd be one solid star in the class. \n\nGot a few weird hits on Turnitin on an assignment and then I got one that was 60% from Coursehero. This doesn't always mean anything--sometimes Turnitin flags stuff that's like...literally words from the textbook.  But 60%? I felt like i had to investigate what was going on.  \n\nWell, it's exactly what you reading this probably realized at the start of the last paragraph if not this entire post. Not only have they been copypasting off coursehero, they have been uploading my assignments and their work to coursehero.  \n\nI'm devastated.  If even my star student is cheating...?  \n\nThey are begging me to let them know how to 'fix it'. Fix it? There is no fixing it, for all the work I now have to do: \n\nI now have the unfun task of having to write all new assignments for the rest of the semester, since my tried and true good ones are all over coursehero.  I found that I can't even do my favorite thing, which is assign an essay exam for the final, since all my take home exam questions are up there...WITH answers.  \n\nNB: I've tried to make a coursehero account but my school's stupid three factor authentication or some nonsense is preventing their email from getting through to validate me.  So I'm stuck having all my years of hard work crafting exams and assignments up there forever.  \n\nSorry for the vent. I'm just so...this is not what I went to grad school to do. I want to TEACH, and I want to spend my pedagogy time working on better teaching...not outfoxing Coursehero ,ChatGPT and all the others.  Thanks for listening.",

I got to 6 figures after 3 years and after 23 years of working and investing I\u2019ve reached FIRE. Don\u2019t hate me. I feel miserable and jealous of the professors who speak at community events, the pretty campuses, the young minds they\u2019ve spent time cultivating. I\u2019m 48 now and starting an online MA degree program. Perhaps I\u2019ll be able to teach at a private high school. Am I nuts to want to become a professor at my age? Maybe this is just midlife regrets/transition. Professors, do you still enjoy your job? Do you find it meaningful? I\u2019d be grateful for any advice. Thank you in advance.",

There seem to be some other non-financial things going on as well, which has left her rather depressed about the whole situation, and I would hate to see a bright student give up on her dream program because of all this.\n\nI do plan to reach out to her and offer my support in whatever capacity I'm able. Maybe she will share more details with me, but this seems time-sensitive, so I wanted to see if anyone here had any advice in the meantime. I was lucky enough that my academics got me a full ride through undergrad, and I found a TA/RA funded position to get my Ph.D. I've thus fortunately (for me) never had to interact with the financial aid system, so I was hoping that someone here might be able to lend me some things to suggest to her.\n\nShe's already been accepted into the program, but her parents won't help her get any financial aid, since it seems like they don't want her to go. I overheard something about her having to work to support either them or her brother against her wishes, which is a whole shit situation that I would love to help her escape.\n\nWhat are her options? Can she secure some kind of student loan without her family's help or input at all (assuming they won't fill out FAFSA or anything)? She's a senior in college, so I assume she's a legal adult and all that. \n\nShould she reach out to the program? The financial aid office there, perhaps, or someone else there? It is apparently a competitive program, and she expressed worry that they might pass her up if she shows signs of struggling to come up with the money. I assume that's not how it works, and that they will try to help her, but I wanted to be sure before I advised that. It's not my field at all, so I don't know anything about how it usually goes.\n\nAre there any other resources anyone else would suggest? Thank you for any and all help or advice!",

        "body": "I am a relatively new adjunct instructor (this is my fourth semester) teaching an introductory courses in philosophy. I have had three sections of the same survey course since I began teaching in 2021, with the exception of the first semester, during which I only taught two sections, and I never received any pedagogy training or real advice on how to develop a course outside of my own experience. While I waited a few years before getting my master's, I'm still only within a decade older than many of my students, and I find that I suffer from a great deal of anxiety and imposter syndrome when it comes to teaching at the university level. Despite how I am closer in age to the students than many of their professors, I'm having difficulty connecting with them in a way that ameliorates any tension or unnaturalness in the classroom.\n\nI find that, especially in my 8:00 class(es), I'm also having trouble rousing students from their daydreaming and then contributing to class discussions. I know that this is a natural consequence of taking a philosophy course at 8 in the morning, but at times I'm not getting as much as a head nod when I ask simple \"yes\" or \"no\" questions to the class. In a philosophy course, this kind of participation is necessary. I'm aware that some disciplines are just not for everyone, but when the atmosphere of the classroom is like this, I find myself increasingly self-conscious and as a result in less of a position to guide the lecture in a way that is natural and ultimately successful in my mind. I do not use any technology, so I don't have a series of PowerPoint slides to assist me, so I often end up reading much of my lecture material verbatim from the notes I have prepared, which makes the experience feel more wooden and thus leads to further degrees of self-consciousness. Typically, I'm pretty good about reading and then lecturing spontaneously after having read some material (in fact, much of the time I don't reference my notes at all), but I can't shake the fear that I'm in some sense deficient as a teacher when I have to resort to lecture notes when there is scarcely any student interaction. I know this has much more to do with me than it does with my students, but I can't seem to break free of the impression that I'm boring students out of their skulls, which is the reason why I'm getting 13 students attending out of a total of 35.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated from a newcomer like myself.",

The problem with that is that we have decent research available about this now, and almost all of it suggests that **there isn't any compelling evidence for this**. \n\nI'll link to some papers and summarize them in a sec, but couple things to point out: Most of this research relies entirely on transient assessments of self-reported 'distress' or 'upset,' meaning that they just ask participants whether or not they felt upset around the time of the event. **This unequivocally isn't harm**; watching the news often makes me momentarily distressed, but it doesn't harm me. So, this research is evaluating the strictest possible standard, which is whether or not asking or talking about certain things makes people feel a bit upset, even briefly. A more precise outcome of 'harm' would probably assess whether there are measurable, ideally objective, effects like impairment in functioning, new mental health symptoms, or big changes in existing symptoms over broader periods of time (although even these outcomes are still dicey). Second, much of this research evaluates much more sensitive topics in much more affected populations than many of you raise this concern about. For example, many of them explore whether asking about sexual assault distresses victims of sexual assault, or whether talking about war, torture, etc. upsets refugees who have fled from conflict. That's **way** more sensitive than many of the examples I see on here or hear people talking about on campus. It's not reading a story in which one of the characters dies or looking at an irreverent painting or asking someone about their drinking in a study. The point is, if this research fails to show that talking about really tragic things with people who have directly and recently experienced them causes them to feel even transiently upset, then you can be pretty confident that a lot of these lower-level things you're giving trigger warnings about don't either. \n\nWith that in mind, almost none of this research provides any clear evidence that asking or talking about sensitive topics routinely results in even meaningfully transient distress, let alone real \"harm.\" Here are a couple good studies: \n\n* [This meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735815000744) of 74k research participants showed that even those with PTSD and/or a history of trauma reported only slightly-more-than-neutral distress after responding to questions about their trauma. They also rated the benefits of participating (so, talking about trauma) highly. So, even if some are slightly distressed, most thought being asked about it was beneficial. \n* [This big survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213420304191) of parents &amp; teens asking about whether they experienced or perpetrated abuse similarly found that about 15% said they found some of the questions upsetting, but 93-98% of those also thought those questions should still be asked. So, literally only 5 people out of 1,000 thought they were upsetting and shouldn't have been asked. \n* [This interview study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10508422.2022.2122466) of almost a thousand Iraqi/Syrian refugee parents and kids, both with and without PTSD, showing that ratings of distress and urge to harm themselves (a real potential harm!) showed that both universally **decreased** after being asked about their experiences, among **all** groups. \n\nSo, not only does it **not** really hurt to ask, but it might actually be beneficial in some cases. This is a bit similar to the tension between what most who know nothing about PTSD insist on believing about it (which seems like basically everybody right now) and what most experts who regularly treat PTSD have known for decades: The symptoms of PTSD (hypervigilance, re-experiencing) are often a direct result of attempts to avoid fears, not stumbling into a conversation about your trauma. Careful, repeated exposure to fears over a prolonged period of time reduces those symptoms (one of the most effective treatments out there for PTSD? Prolonged exposure). So, the answer isn't avoiding stuff that makes you uncomfortable at all costs, and I think it's especially important not to model that behavior for others. If they think you know what you're talking about, they might follow your lead.  \n\nSome people wave this evidence off by saying, \"well, it could still cause mental health problems down the line or in ways that we/participants can't specifically identify.\" Not trying to be mean, but we need to be direct: If you're thinking that, you're seeing ghosts. You're doing some Olympic-level gymnastics to try to hang onto your belief that what you do has a way bigger effect on people than it actually does, and I doubt there is any degree of evidence that would convince you otherwise. Most people who say this have really limited experience in mental health or research generally. If they did, I think it'd ring true when I tell them that 99% of my students, participants, and patients can't even remember what you talked about with them last week, let alone experience severe effects on their mental health over long periods of time from it. \n\nThe thing is: even if you did believe that showing certain content to students, or asking them certain questions, or talking about certain topics *could* actually harm them, most people are doing more than enough to mitigate whatever harm that could result already. You're giving them warnings &amp; letting them decide to leave if they want to engage with it or not. You're telling people that you're going to ask them about it in your consents, and then letting them not answer those questions if they want to. **These things are all good things to do, but mostly just because it's courteous and gives people agency in deciding when they're ready to think/talk about something, not because springing it on them will damage them forever. It won't, just like it won't damage them when they inevitably stumble onto similar things in their everyday lives. Because they do.**  \n\nI'm not saying you all should go find the most gruesome video you can find and show it to your students for fun, I'm saying the answer isn't to treat everything as more dangerous and harmful than it really is or let concerns about that chill your teaching or your research. And, most of all, I think it's time to put this claim to bed, in teaching, in research, everywhere. If you hear it in reviewing a study, for example, I hope you'll push back on it. And if I student complains to your department that you've damaged them by raising a sensitive topic, I hope you'll push on it there, too.",

We knew this was probably not ideal, so we got serious at looking closely at whether all of it was necessary. \n\nThe other department was helpful and provided us all the most recent final exams and course outlines for review. We studied them and came up with recommendations, and had a meeting where we leanred that what we had just read was mostly wrong. \n\nWe're in Canada, where academic freedom often means classroom sovereignty. What's written in the academic calendar may not exactly match what's being taught at the lectern. A topic we need may or may not be taught depending on who's teaching that term. It can be quite politically delicate. Anyway, we will be making some recommendations of course changes and provide a list of foundational concepts that need to be covered in certain courses. (We have a collegial handle on our own courses.)\n\nBut how do we follow up on this long term? I can gently ask each professor for a copy of exams and outlines each year, but I don't want to push this detente between departments.\n\nThe other option is to ask our students for their notes and homework. How can we convey we're not spying on the students, and also make it not seem that it's such a bad thing to spy on the other department? Is it just too strange to keep a file of students notes to review how other faculty are delivering their courses?",

This semester, I have a handful of persistently aggressive and combative male students in one course that I\u2019m teaching.

Sometimes it will be to ask a question that they\u2019re genuinely curious about, but more often, it will be to argue with me and what I am teaching. \n\nToday was an absolute disaster and the worst day of the semester by far. I was teaching a class about gender-based economic issues, and these boys pretty much had a meltdown the entire class. To make a long story short, they were interrupting and challenging me the entire time, directly trying to refute what I was teaching, and being wilfully ignorant. \n\nAs just one example out of many, when I was trying to teach about how the market undervalues \u201cfeminine\u201d work skills, one of them said, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong, wages are determined by supply and demand,\u201d and when I corrected him and referenced some studies to prove my point, he interrupted me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, because that would be hard to measure.\u201d Another one of them was emphatically shaking his head \u201cno\u201d intermittently while I was teaching, which I found incredibly rude and frustrating. \n\nI\u2019ve never had this problem before. Should I not engage with any irrelevant comments that they\u2019re making? I feel like doing so damages my credibility in the eyes of the other students, since these boys are openly trying to prove me wrong. Should I ask them to hold comments until the end? Should I tell them in front of the class that their behavior is disruptive to other students? \n\nAny advice would help lift a huge weight off of my shoulders. Thank you!",

We have young kids together, and this institution wouldn't hire me as an assistant professor. Instead, they offered me a postdoc position, implying they \\*might\\* hire me after. We are in different departments. \n\nwhat would you do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.Grab a chance to be an assistant professor at an R2 and FAR way from the partner? I will keep the kids. it will be challenging for me to juggle the kids and the newly hired faculty job. But this new city has better schools/activities/parks/even beaches for the kids. Nobody knows when my partner could join us as.\n\n2. Take a risk and stay in the same town, become a postdoc, and publish like a machine. My family stays together. And hopefully, I get an assistant professor position here OR we move together as a package deal. Nothing is promised. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/113et2i)",

        "body": "I have been invited to an interview in about a week, and have been asked to give a 10 minute teaching demo (over Zoom). I've looked around the sub, but have found less than I expected on the topic of the teaching demo (or at least demos of this length)!  I'm wondering if any of you have experience or advice (from the perspective of the interviewer or the interviewee) that you could offer about how to approach such a short demo.\n\nFor some context: The last time I gave a teaching demo it was 25 minutes, to an audience of faculty (no students), and honestly did not go very well. I tried to take all of the advice I could find - I was told that I should make the demo interactive, rather than strictly lecture-style, and as close to my natural teaching style as possible. I think I provided good context/structure for the demo (and decided to mostly take the approach of actively \"teaching,\" rather than simply discussing how I *would teach*, although I did a bit of that for framing as well). \n\nWhen it came down to it, though, my attempts to engage the committee completely flopped. The discussion questions and activities I incorporated were met with stoney silence. I could not get them to say anything (these were discussion prompts I've used with students many times, and they are generally very animated about). By the end I was so frazzled I don't even remember the second half. It was not anything like a true classroom teaching experience. Needless to say I did not get the job.\n\nI suppose this is all in the back of my mind as I prepare for this demo, with the added stress of just not knowing how I can fit anything substantial into 10 minutes (if I do - in spite of my resistance - try to incorporate \"discussion\" or an activity again, that would take up most of my time! So would it be better not to, and just describe *how* I generally teach? Perhaps with an outline of an average class?). \n\nReally any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.",

ChatGPT recommended a few papers that absolutely fit that (including brief summaries of their content) and that were published in some of the most renowned journals in my field.\n\nTo be honest: This had me panicking for a moment: How could I\u2019ve missed these (been working in this project for well over a year now)\u2026?\n\nI looked them up (ChatGPT gave a full reference in APA-style) and none of these existed. Asked back and was given other \u201cofficial\u201d looking references for these (altered title and altered journal). Again, none of these existed.\n\nSearched extensively for the authors (of which I had not heard before, but that sounded similar to authors I knew). And\u2026 you guessed it: non existent as well.\n\nOn the one hand this shows the limits of an otherwise cool technology but it also had me thinking in terms of teaching: these references looked absolutely genuine at first sight and if a student had used them in a paper, chances are that I would not have noticed that. They could have handed in an impressive reference list from renowned journals on the exact topic of their paper - with references that were completely made up\u2026 Really has me thinking\u2026",

Or if you ever noticed a colleague with scars, how was that received in your uni? Did anyone even notice?  \n\nI'm a new TT prof since September and was able to wear long sleeves in the Fall and Winter to hide old self harms scars. The most apparent one are not super obviously self harm but if someone is sitting next to me they could easily notice especially if they know what self harm scars can look like. \n\nWith Summer coming along, I know I'll be away from the uni more and doing fieldwork rather than teaching but I am concerned about some these old self harm scars.  As a grad student and postdoc, I mostly hid these in professional settings. When I didn't I actually had a couple instances where other grad students very loudly and publicly asked me what they were in front of everyone. Most people didn't notice/care but those whose did were vocal and loud about it.  \n\nIn most settings I don't care and wear tshirts but I'm a bit concerned in professional settings, especially now with the TT job, that it may impact my colleagues' and boss's views of me. They will ultimately be part of my tenure application committee in a few years.  \n\nI'm also concerned about the students. On the one hand I want to be an advocate for mental health and show you can be successful no matter your struggles. On the other hand I'm concerned about their perception and it making me look bad as a prof. I am also serving a population with many people new to North America so I'm not sure how they would react as they may be less exposed to conversations around self harm.\n\nI'm just overall concerned, and to be honest getting tired of wearing long sleeves all the time even in Winter. I have nice shorter sleeves that I've avoided wearing due to this. I feel like I'm in highschool again hiding my arms cause I'm afraid it'll get me in trouble and it sucks.  Has anyone else been in this situation? Any words of wisdom or advice? Am I overthinking this?",

It went well, and I have a zoom call with the department head tomorrow to begin negotiations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy spouse is a currently a postdoc in a different field at a different nearby institution. He was still a grad student when I began my current position, so we chose not seek spousal accommodations at the time. When I interviewed for this new position, I asked about spousal accommodations (without revealing too many details), and they said they typically offer two years of soft funds while they try to organize something better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is my spouse has become very competitive in his field. A couple months ago, he received an offer from an R1 that he turned down because that institution couldn't do anything for me. He interviewed at two other R1 schools in the past two weeks, one of which let him know during the interview that he's the top candidate. Given this situation, we're reluctant to accept a \"two-year soft funds\" type of situation. I realize two tenure-track positions is a huge ask, but I keep thinking that if we weren't married to each other, we would both already be in tenure-track positions at R1 institutions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith respect to the \"two-year soft funds\" arrangement, I can't help but feel that sometimes institutions automatically assume that a candidate's spouse isn't competitive for tenure-track. Naturally I am planning to talk him up when requesting a spousal accommodation, but like... surely it's going to seem like I'm biased since I'm married to him lol. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to best communicate to this new institution that my spouse is a boss. Thank you!",

        "body": "I teach an inquiry-based research writing class for college freshmen. I have a student whose research topic is \"The Negative Effects of Not Breastfeeding.\" I think this research topic is too narrow. I've been encouraging this student to broaden the scope of the topic to just \"breastfeeding\" but she insists that she already knows a lot about this topic because her sister is currently breastfeeding two young children and she (my student) is planning to become an OB/GYN. I challenged her topic by asking her to consider cases in which breastfeeding isn't an option, but she says that question isn't relevant to her topic (fair enough). I then asked her who she believed was her audience and she answered \"new mothers who are trying to decide if they should breastfeed.\" Again, fair enough, but I don't like that her research project excludes mothers and infants for whom breastfeeding isn't possible. She just submitted an annotated bibliography, and while some of the studies she's consulted say that the results are inconclusive, many of her selected pro-breastfeeding studies are limited to a small number (100 or fewer) infants and mothers of a certain age and income level, which again, I believe is too limited in scope. However, when I address this with my student, it seems like the narrowness of the study is precisely what appeals to her because that is her target audience.\n\nI'm feeling very frustrated by this project, but I can't tell if there is truly a problem with her project or if I'm just letting my personal biases get in the way of good teaching. Furthermore, if there is a problem with this project, I have no idea where to begin in trying to get her on track. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.",

        "body": "Some of the productivity advice I heard as a student (break things up into smaller tasks to avoid procrastination, do the most difficult task first, create a routine, etc.) simply do not work for some people.  For instance, I can\u2019t do the pomodoro technique or work in highly structured environments.  It does not motivate me, and it makes work become even more of a chore.  \n\nI also cannot reward myself to stay motivated.  Perhaps it\u2019s because I grew up in an abusive environment and was in a DV relationship for a while.  I am used to feeling deprived of basic needs, so if I fail and don\u2019t reward myself, it doesn\u2019t have much of an effect because I am able to survive in that state of mind.  If I do reward myself, I enjoy it, but I know the feeling of being in survival mode again, and I expect it.  My mental state has actually improved a lot after being in therapy, and I don\u2019t know how various techniques will be for me in the future, but I think my experiences now are worth mentioning.\n\nI have waves of productivity, and my work is much better when I am considering the tasks that I complete based on my mental state.  It causes me less stress, which results in me being in a better mood and getting more done.  When I\u2019m forcing myself into a routine, I get more stressed, and that can cause me to burn out.\n\nI have tasks that are prioritized, and I also consider the difficulty of doing the task.  If I\u2019m in a bad state of mind, forcing myself to do a difficult task will be a grueling and unproductive process.  If I do some of the easier tasks, I\u2019ll at least get those out of the way.  And then the next day, I\u2019ll feel refreshed and ready to tackle the difficult task.  If I\u2019m in a bad enough mental state that I\u2019m still not getting things done, maybe that\u2019s a sign I need to take the day off work.  I keep that open as an option.  I\u2019ve done it occasionally, but most of the time, it ends up being unnecessary.  But having that as an option relieves the stress, which helps tremendously.\n\nIf it\u2019s at the point where I\u2019m feeling like I need to keep taking time off work, that would mean I\u2019d probably need to look into a career change.  So I don\u2019t stress myself out over it.  I\u2019ll recognize that I\u2019m struggling at the moment, and I have to do what I have to do, even if it means I end up quitting my job or something.  Giving myself a little bit of space helps a lot, then I\u2019m usually able to power through and get things done without work actually being affected.\n\nI also do not commit to one type of productivity tactic because my life is constantly fluctuating.  If the productivity tactic you are trying to implement becomes stressful or anxiety-inducing, maybe you need to switch it up (even if you\u2019ve been doing this successfully before).\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is a perfect system (deadlines do exist), but maybe it would be helpful for some people\u2026I\u2019ve talked about it with students, and many of them found it very useful to hear this perspective.  I tell them to think about everything that would happen if they didn\u2019t do well on an assignment.  What options are there?  List them all out.  Even dropping out of college is an option, honestly.  Life is just a series of choices\u2026\n\nI\u2019m curious what works for other profs, when it comes to productivity?",

        "body": "I am continually taken aback by the lack of critical thinking skills I observe among STEM students. I am speaking of things I consider to be very simple. Example: I can ask a students,  \"If 20/4 =5, what is 20/0.4?\" and I am met with mostly blank faces as most scramble for calculators.  Or if using a 100X stock solution, and they know to add 1.0 ml to 99.0 ml, most cannot tell me how to perform the same operation with a 50X stock solution. More complicated, yet still simple examples, they will do a problem which calls for the answer to be in a particular unit (lets say ml), get an answer with the unit being moles and cannot see that it is incorrect. \n\nI have read about feral or isolated children who never develop language skills. And it is an accepted fact that if a child does not develop language skills by a certain age, that child may know words, but can never formulate sentences. Have similar studies been conducted with critical thinking skills? If a child is not exposed to logic and reasoning by a certain age, will that child always lack the ability to reason?",

        "body": "Background: \nI've been in higher education for over a decade on the staff side and an adjunct faculty for about 5 years, pretty much only teaching online classes with pre-created syllabi and very little room for creativity. I have a master's degree and given the route I had to take to pursue my education, did not attend schools or programs with opportunities for research, presentations, or committees. I do employee training as my current full-time staff role so I am teaching consistently, though it's a different format. In this role, I do create my curriculum and assessments.\n\nI've applied for a FT faculty role at a local community college. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this is truly my end-goal, long-term, dream job. Of course I'm excited about things like state benefits and such, but I really love teaching and am interested in doing so at a teaching college (I'd rather avoid the pressure of a research focused role and focus on student success), and the school is in my city which I'm very involved in and love dearly.\n\nCurrent Process:\nI've been asked to interview for this FT faculty role. It will involve a short teaching opportunity based on a provided scenario and will be a panel interview. \n\nThe imposter syndrome I'm feeling is UNREAL. I'm a good teacher, empathic, engaging, passionate, and my feedback from students in my online classes and trainees is always outstanding. Still, I'm terrified that I don't deserve this interview, or that they've got WAY more experienced candidates and probably already know who they'd like to hire (maybe one of their current adjuncts or someone with a doctorate and tons of research experience). \n\nHow do I talk myself out of that mindset? How do I stand out and do EVERYTHING I can to make sure they consider me? \n\nOr... Am I really not worthy of this role? Will I ever get out of the cubicle and into the classroom, so to speak?\n\nSorry to ramble a bit, but my mind has been spinning for a week since I got the interview invitation, which I had assumed wouldn't come and was \"grieving\" the missed opportunity (after a faculty friend of mine from a local university has me convinced that since I hadn't heard anything I probably want moving forward).\n\nThanks for reading and any advice or thoughts.",

The job ad and search committee interaction up to now has underscored that being Catholic is not a requirement, however, as part of the hiring process I have written a \"Response to the Catholic Mission\" and will meet with faculty and administrators whose focus is the religious aspect of the college as part of the campus visit.\n\nI am not Catholic, and mostly identify as an atheist. I do, though, explicitly write about religiosity (and especially Catholicism) in my work.\n\nSimilarly I am not American, though I've lived here for the best part of a decade, and though I have made efforts to shift to being more respectful of living in a much more religious country, I'm definitely not perfect in that regard. \n\nPeculiar to this situation is that the position is in the arts, and sharing my creative work will be the bulk of the job talk. \n\nI would love to hear any and all advice on interviewing as a non-religious person at this kind of institution, and in particular, these are my current panic questions, in no particular order!: \n\n\\- I swear a LOT, like the working class gal I am-- how much more careful should I be? (obviously I do tone this down in professional situations!)\n\n\\- is conservatism of dress a factor I should consider?\n\n\\-should I \"lean in\" to the Catholic themes of my creative work, or not risk any offence and steer clear altogether?\n\n\\- what very obvious concerns should I have but am missing??\n\nThanks y'all in advance-- this community has been such a succour, even as a lurker, navigating the market these past few years.",

It is a self-perpetuating cycle with no end to it until the entire humanity is enslaved by technology or die in climate related natural disaster. How many ChatGPT and Dalle-2 are we going to create before all the creative minds starve to death? Nobody is genuinely trying to solve any problem with their research, we are all here to collect a pay-cheque, we are lucky if we are not creating more problems during the process. \n\nAll research that seeks to find equality, promote well being, understanding the human condition, etc., simple reinforces human dominated natural order, which kills up to 150 other species that happen to share this earth with us. What do humans do when they are all charged up and \"well\"? My life long observation tells me that they are going to reinforce existing systems of exploitation ten-fold. Also, I'm pretty sure humans are not going to stop exploiting nature even when we reach that mythical state where we are finally at peace with each other. \n\nSo you are in pure math or something abstract that has no relevance to society in the foreseeable future, does that somehow absolve your responsibility in participating in this sick and exploitative system? No, in fact if anything you are the gatekeepers buttressing the system even further, while consuming an disproportionate amount of resources doing so. How about applying your mind to something productive such as halting our war against the fricking biosphere. \n\nI am genuinely proposing that all professors in academia STOP doing research and start preaching the truth, which is that the current system is fundamentally corrupt and putting nature in serious jeopardy.  \n\nIf you laugh this off, then you are a part of the problem.",

        "body": "So at my community college there are lots of classes that are all online except for a few in-person proctored tests. Online classes have grown in popularity, they are usually some of the first classes filled during registration each semester. Some students also have an academic accommodation with the Disability Office for remote testing. This means that the majority of the class shows up and takes a proctored test in a classroom and one or two students take their test at home while being watched by a live proctor over Zoom. The proctor is not allowed to do a room scan because of a court ruling from Ohio a while back.\n\nMany math profs agreed that this kind of proctoring wasn't really valid proctoring during the early days of the pandemic because we can't guarantee that the student doesn't have access to other resources just outside of the camera frame. That is why we made it a requirement that math classes have proctored in-person tests. This type of academic accommodation was never used prior to the pandemic that anyone in the department can remember. The Disability Office says that if we don't allow the accommodation then there is a possibility that we could be sued.\n\nMy questions for you all:\n\nIs remote proctoring an example of an academic accommodation at your college? (This probably only really makes sense if you teach at a commuter type of college.)\n\nDo you feel that remote proctoring is able to maintain the integrity of the test?",
