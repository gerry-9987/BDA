What would be the key pointed questions you would want to ask the applicants that address the crazy stuff we are all faced with in this post-pandemic landscape. I'm planning on asking about their thoughts on device policies and student mental health because that's the fight I have the most in my classrooms due to a lack of enforceable policy.\n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome and appreciated.",

The MIT program through CWU, that offers a dual cert, but the application window would require me to wait to start. There's an alternative route (3 or 4) through CityU I could do that would put me in the classroom starting this fall while also taking classes, and finishing up this upcoming spring.\n\nThe WGU and CityU programs seem the most compelling to me.\n\nSome background: I have an MS in mathematics as well as a BS in physics and math. I've been doing some subbing on an emergency cert. I've taught math at the college level as a TA and as an adjunct. I have been working at a franchised tutoring center for math education for students.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone have any experience with these programs and are willing to share thoughts? Or anyone going through alt routes 3 or 4.\n2. Should I pursue physics or math as a first certification? Math seems like the best bet, since everyone takes it, and there are many different math classes.\n3. Is the timeline reasonable, especially for WGU?\n4. Is the MIT worth it if I already have an MS?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "(Long story short: I'd love some both positive and negative perspectives on teaching, so that I can decide whether or not it is a good career to get into. I'm in Y10 in the UK, and a family member (who has nothing to do with the UK education system) very much condemns the idea, so I'd like to hear from teachers themselves)\n\n\nHi teachers,\n\nAs you can probably tell, I'm not a teacher myself, I'm a year 10 student in the UK and that age-old question everyone faces at this time is playing on my mind, 'What do I actually want to be when I grow up?'\n\nFor most of my life, I've wanted to become a doctor, working in Paediatrics to be precise. I love helping people (as clich\u00e8 as that sounds) and I've always wanted to focus that on children. However, recently, I've thought through that idea too much and I've realised that I don't really want to be working in medicine, I can't imagine myself taking a science-type subject at A-Level, never mind degree level, its just not something that I want. \n\nThat leads us to the past year, where the idea of becoming a teacher has played on my mind on and off. All of my friends tell me that I would make a great teacher, and I absolutely love parting my knowledge of a subject, especially since I could talk the hind legs off a donkey (as you can tell by this very long-winded post, apologies). And I genuinely think I could become a teacher, and I'd definitely enjoy it. Maybe not all parts of it, but overall I think that, for me, it would be an enjoyable career. I am also a massive fan of English, I am incredibly passionate about reading, writing poems and other things like that, so I think teaching English would genuinely interest me, and I'd be happy to take English in both further and higher education.\n\nHowever, I explained all of this to my mum yesterday. My mum is the type of person to say one thing, but her wording and actions will convince you of something totally different, and that was very much the case here. She constantly tells me that she will be proud of me for whatever career path I choose to take,  but it seems to me like that means \"whatever you choose, as long as you choose something I like\" because she was not at all happy at the thought of me becoming a teacher. She tells me that it's for my own sake, and that I'll never be happy as a teacher due to the hoops you have to jump through and the red tape you have to deal with, though she's not a teacher herself so I don't see how she could know that so confidently. To cut a long story short because I'm well aware nobody has the time to read all of this, we had quite a long conversation about it, and my mum told me to ask actual teachers what they think about teaching, and whether or not they think it is a good career to get into.\n\nSo that's what I'd like if any of you have any time. I'm open to both positive and negative perspectives and opinions, preferably from the UK as that is where I would be teaching, although international perspectives would be appreciated also! \n\nI'm very aware that teaching isn't all pretty, happy, 9-5, long holidays and 5 day weeks, and I'm eternally grateful to the teaching profession. I think you are all amazing human beings, and the pillars of society, without you we would be nowhere. Thank you to all of you for all you do \u2764\n\nGood luck to any of you taking strike action this week also! You are supported :)\n\nIzzy",

        "body": "How bad is the outlook when a principal suggests that you can bring a Union rep to a meeting? I am \"in trouble\" for being accused of not working with the correct students in an activity program our school runs one day a week during school hours, and for allegedly going straight home from the program (missing about 5 minutes of dismissal time). I am a para and otherwise have enjoyed a more relaxing year (was teaching last year) and have great student relationships.   \n\n\nMy principal said they want to hear my side of the story, but that I can bring a union rep. I did speak to our VP and explained what had happened immediately after seeing the said email, they seemed to think it wasn't a big deal and accepted my explanation until I mentioned the union rep part.   \n\n\nI can't believe I am getting \"in trouble\" when I worked so hard helping kids in this program and did a lot of extra work above and beyond to help those who were struggling to learn. I even got an email a couple of weeks ago from the organizer on what a great job I was doing working with the students. I'm also a bit shocked that whoever \"told one me\" (probably the same person who sent me the complimentary email) simply didn't check with me first as there are simple and legitimate explanations. I don't know what to expect. I couldn't work as a para very long (pay is way too low) but hoped to finish out the year and saw no reason I wouldn't until that email popped up yesterday afternoon.",

It is legitimately at that point now where I feel like I have no other options besides let 90% fail or just go full on tyrant mode. I am the nicest teacher too and I feel taken advantage of at every turn.",

Of course, with its growing popularity, some of my students used AI to write their texts for them, namely Chat GPT. I was wondering if you had a surefire way to identify/detect AI writing? I have tried some of the AI detectors online but it does not work. However, When I read my students' work, I know that they could not possibly have written that, I know their individual writing skills by this time of the year. However, sometimes I know for a fact it was not written by them, but I cannot prove it in any way, and therefore have to give a good grade. Any suggestions?",

        "body": "Like the title says I'm looking for advice and/or possible solutions to try in one of my worst 8th grade classes.  \n\nToday after introducing the new seating chart, which was highly needed, I have about half the class refuse to sit in their assigned seats, arguing loudly and swearing when told to move to their new seats.  It got to the point where it finally was my last straw (the last couple months have been increasingly worse and along with other personal/health issues going on, my nerves couldn't take it), I called in my vice principal to help. I have a very good relationship with her so not worried about backlash, but am embarrassed that it came to that point.  \n\nSome context:\n\n1. 8th grade US History, about 30 students.\n2. Very SPED/Behavior plan heavy - over 50% of the class.  Used to have a para until she quit around winter break, and have not gotten a new para hired to replace her.\n3. Several students are major behavior issues (on Tier 3 plans, drama causing, etc) and no consequences have worked on them (lunch detention, after school detention, calling parents, etc).\n4. Major issues with gaslighting and cell phone usage, no support from parents.\n5. Definitely feel like I have no respect or relationship with half the class, despite trying since day 1.\n6. I've tried different engagement activities, seating charts, consequences/rewards, having 1-on-1 conversations with students, etc.\n\nI'm at my wits end with this. My other two 8th grade classes are not nearly this bad (my 7th period has some knuckleheads but not near this extent).  It's to the point that it's causing my health issues to get worse.  I would appreciate any suggestions or advice you can offer!",

        "body": "I just read two stories about this. Each story went into great detail about Hilton's accusations. Neither story made any attempt to get the teacher's side of the story, or to see if any of this is true. The entire story was just her making the accusation (right when it's time for her new book to come out and she needs some publicity for it), and now, if this guy is still alive or still teaching, his reputation is ruined. \n\nI am a male and a middle school teacher. I can't imagine that 30 years from now, as I'm enjoying my retirement, one of my students, who becomes famous, decides to accuse me of being inappropriate with them 30 years prior, and everyone just assumes I'm guilty. \n\nIn 2007, I took a teaching position at a high school where I'd been an aide three years earlier. A girl with special needs, who was a senior then, and a freshman when I was an aide, saw me in the hallway on the first day of school, and told her teacher that I'd once told a dirty joke near her (not to her, but near her) when I worked there three years earlier. It was a completely false accusation. The girl had a history of trying to stir up drama. It was a part of her special needs diagnosis. \n\nBut, since I was a new hire and still in the probationary period, the school let me go. I had to show up at 6am one morning to quietly get all of my stuff out of my class. There wasn't much, because I'd just started. Still, it was only her word against mine, and it cost me my job. \n\nAnd, even while reading this, a lot of you will assume that I was guilty, or that false accusations are rare. It's frustrating.",

Because I don\u2019t want kids like this getting away with bullying. That substitute doesn\u2019t deserve that. I also commented on the video saying this is wrong to post and someone with their full name commented back to me saying \u201cquit crying\u201d which I reported. I searched up the name on google and found a high school name which I 80% believe is the school. Because the comments on the video are from kids saying that they hate that substitute and laughing at her.\n\n\nUPDATE: Just got an email from one of the staffs saying:\n\n\u201cThank you for taking the time to email about the posting. I believe I know enough from the shared clipping and TikTok to determine who the students are.\n\nYes, TikTok and other social media sites are generally not interested in removing content unless it is shamefully inappropriate or violent.\u201d\n\nSo hopefully, they will talk to the kids and actually get the video taken down.",

I gave them a week and a day of 90 minute class sessions to do a 5 paragraph essay. I scaffolded and gave constant reminders and one on one bell: 13 of them still didn\u2019t do it. Grades are also due, I\u2019m looking on advice on how to proceed. I\u2019ve found parents in this class particularly difficult to reach via phone. My question is, what would you do in my case?

When he asked why he couldn't join their wrestling game they answered \"because you smell of dog-piss\". Normally I wouldn't take this type of behaviour lightly, however..... I gotta say they're right. This kid doesn't smell nice, and it's caused by him sleeping in the same bed with his dogs, nothing medical, and purely by choice (we've had a home visit there some time ago). We've mentioned the importance of hygiene multiple times, both directly and indirectly to both the parents and the boy himself, but they're not changing it. There's a social worker in the family for one of his siblings, but there's no signs of neglect or anything like that. Me and my principal are at a loss for words now. Any ideas on how we could reply to this without seeming rude or causing a scene?",

But this work place feels too much. Like my supervisor/administrator is the most amazing women I absolutely admire. However, all the yelling and stress I endure from her is not doing great things to me. As much as I love my boss, her stress always lands on me. This has been happening so frequently I feel like a crap teacher. \n\nI feel so stuck. Like at one point I wish for a serious illness or excuse just to quit it all. I loved working with children all my life. I still do love working with the children. But am I just wasting my time now with college? \n\nAll the advice i get is well she sees you as family and typically you treat family like crap. But like that didn\u2019t really help me.

I just completed my very first Education class as well as student teaching for the last couple of months at a local middle school. In my Education class, I learned a lot on how to engage students through hands on activities which resulted in students retaining the information better. However, all of the activities were for basic concepts that you learn in elementary school and beginning of middle school. At the middle school I was student teaching at, I was placed with 7th graders. The style of this class was warm up, brief notes, and a quick assignment that you work on alone which made the students seem not very interested in class.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019ve just taken one Education class so I don\u2019t know much yet and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn more teaching techniques. However, I was just curious on how you keep students engaged in math class in high school. What activities do students tend to like in high school? I know math isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite subject so how do you keep students engaged in class? Any other advice or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!!",

Admin was never at the meetings where mom explained how happy she was with me and our school and how well he\u2019s doing in comparison. \n\nAnyway- he\u2019s started to try and push boundaries a bit and admin has basically told me I need to be more punitive. Send him to recess detention, take away his computer etc. I expressed to them that I was walking the line carefully and picking my battles with him because I want to protect the relationship I\u2019ve built with him. This kid has one dead parent, a horrific home life and a ton of trauma. \n\nAdmin said thanks for building that relationship, but please do what we say basically. Well now the kid is telling me hates me, wants to go back to his old school, and has become super disruptive. Before he was sometimes using class time to play blooket but was getting all of his work done, happy, and not bothering anyone else. \n\nI\u2019m questioning myself because maybe I am too forgiving/permissive with kids? I generally feel good about my classroom management and get good feedback during observations but admin seems to think the problem is I was letting this kid get away with some things. \n\nJust feeling like not my best teacher self this week!",

        "body": "Context: I\u2019m a former elementary ELA teacher and have worked with grades 1, 2, and 4. I\u2019ve also worked in reading intervention. I am trained in science of reading pedagogy and have my masters. I now work in literacy research (no longer a teacher)\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed: Even prior to the pandemic I always saw that so many students were coming in with little to no skills - depending on the grade\u2026 but some would have no alphabet, letter sounds, phonological awareness. Others couldn\u2019t retain sight words. So many students were entering the school year with little to no literacy skills, even if they\u2019ve been in school since PreK where phonological awareness and letters are taught. \n\nI feel like it should be obvious, but I don\u2019t think the explanation is always the same. I want to know, in your opinion, what you think is at play here. If students are receiving explicit instruction, and the year before, and the year before that, *what* is happening to make kids forget so much? Why are some kids arriving to PreK without even any alphabet exposure?\n\nAre some kids really slow to retain the information? Are this many kids experiencing profound enough trauma that it alters their ability to remember?Are some parents unaware that their kids need to practice the alphabet and sounds? I want to always assume the best but truly, I have never understood how so many kids can come in with so many deficits each year. I want to know how we can sustain students\u2019 skills and catch them up",

        "body": "Hey folks!\n\nJust a quick about me, I'm sat on my Art K-12 Praxis and my MS Science Praxis, looking for jobs after going through my first year of an alternative route to teaching programme.  I have no teaching experience aside from some library classes I've run, projects with my kids taken from curriculums, and nearly two decades of youth work.  I know that I have some theory but haven't had the chance to put anything into practice.\n\nThis is long and I aplogise, but we're at the end of our rope and I need to find understanding - either me understanding the mentality of the teacher, or understanding that I've got the right idea of the teacher...\n\nHaving said that...\n\nMy kid's third grade teacher has been talking to us about my kid's behaviour but hasn't seemed to be willing to take any advice that we're able to offer.\n\nAbout my kiddo.  Super smart.  ADHD; Allergic to 7/8 top allergens for the first three years of his life and started growing out of it a few years ago (read: gut health messed up, etc.); non-verbal until he was two and a half; resistant (subconsciously and overtly) to change of plans - however small; compulsively corrective; oblivious to social cues and appropriate timing of conversation(s); little-to-no eye contact when engaging others or being spoken to; needs to finish whatever he has set his mind to finish and melts down if he's moved on to something else too quickly; meticulous attention to trivial details.\n\nI've got an autistic brother.  I worked with adults with learning needs for the first year I moved over to the states.  I saw some things in my kid when he was younger that started me thinking about whether he was on the spectrum, and over the past two years or so it's become more apparent.  He's autistic.\n\nDoesn't change how I feel about him, of course, but boy am I sensitive to those in authority that do not give him the time of day.\n\nWe recently met with his teacher, his principal, two of his therapists, and the school counsellor in what one of the therapists later described to me as \"The most unprofessional display and frustrating parent/teacher meetings \\[he's\\] ever seen.\"  He couldn't believe that the teacher would boast of over two decades of classroom experience and still claim that our kid was the worst she's ever seen.  He said that her personal attacks on both our kid and my wife (at one point calling them both manipulative, amongst other things) wree uncalled for and my feeling was that the meeting was held as a formality in order for the teacher to air her frustrations and complaints at us.\n\nThing is... we talked to her at the start of the year about his diagnoses and that his social behaviour, especially, is difficult.  We also had a conference call in November about the same thing.  We ALSO told her that last year, the second grade teacher had a good relationship with the therapists, called on them as regularly as she needed, and by the end of the year my then second grader was at a 5th grade in math and a 4.7 in reading.  This year, he's failing reading.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" is an acceptable statement, but if the advice we then provide is not followed, I start to get mad.\n\nSee, I provided all I could at the time (two weeks ago as the latest date).  Showing them the diagnoses through our MyMercy app - Unspecified disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorder 9/11/19.  ADHD 9/11/19.  Unspecified anxiety disorder 1/11/21.  But they said two things:  Unless it's specifically an autism diagnosis, and unless it's on paper, then he's getting GenEd like the rest.\n\nWe're dealing with a teacher who's lesson template works for the majority, but she's making our kid walk at the back of the line every day.  She's telling him if he doesn't want to work in a group, he can work on his own.  So he's not getting any interaction in the classroom.\n\nThe kid's on meds for anxiety and worry; one of the meds was prescribed after he voiced suicidal thoughts and feelings at 5 years old.  He has a hard time as it is.  But this teacher's unwillingness to accommodate is piling up the straws on this camel's back.\n\nI went to the doctor with him today to get some referrals to dietary therapists and for an educational psychologist, so hopefully we're going to be getting somewhere soon.  God bless him, the therapist at the school has been one of our biggest advocates and is fighting to make things right, but the school staff have very little respect for him - talking over him twice in the meeting we had the other week.\n\nI'm not sure what I expect from this rant.  I understand that every parent is going to side with their kid.  And I know mine isn't perfect - we have him the rest of the time he's not in the classroom!  But asking what we do to deal with him, then telling us that that's not possible in the classroom, *then* asking us what *they* should do in the classroom to handle him seems to be pushing it a little too far out of the responsibility of the teacher and support of the principal, and further back on us - when we can't even be there to do it! And when we tell the teacher to call the therapists to help *as the teacher last year did*, she just tells us that she doesn't know what days of the week they're in!\n\nOh, and to call our parenting into question is beyond disrespectful.\n\nI've got a parent/teacher conference later this week, so I'm going to be mindful of what I can bring to the table this time instead of sitting back and letting her vent about how my child is (again) \"the worst she's ever seen.\"",

I need all the help I can get before it goes too far. \n\nHe\u2019s my science teacher, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a bad student, I always get A\u2019s and try to keep to myself. \n\nHere are just a couple of the most noticeable things he does (my friends have observed him doing these things and told me): \n\n* He\u2019s almost always staring at me even when he\u2019s not teaching, I can sometimes tell out of my peripheral vision that he\u2019s looking at me \n* If he\u2019s talking about something with me, he\u2019ll sometimes make me stay after class just to finish the conversation\n* He subtly insists that I sit in the front of the class, even though we change our seats frequently\n* When taking a test, he\u2019s always talking to me or still staring at me or trying to initiate eye contact\n* Every time he\u2019s talking to someone else, he always looks at me too, even when I\u2019m not a part of the conversation\n* Even when he is teaching, he doesn\u2019t call on me normally because I\u2019m quiet in general but he continuously makes eye contact with me, which has honestly taken a toll on my confidence and I\u2019ve stopped making eye contact with a lot of my teachers and peers and friends because of how uncomfortable I\u2019ve been getting\n* Some of my friends have told me that its a little unfair how much more he pays attention to me compared to everyone else, which I understand I think\n\nPlease let me know what I can do about this situation. I really used to like him as a teacher and wanted to ask to be his student aide but I just don\u2019t know how comfortable I am around him anymore. It\u2019s come to the point where it\u2019s disrupting my education because of the part where he talks to me during tests. \n\nI will accept any and all advice! Thank you all.",

I'm starting to look into applying for some teaching positions as they open up for next school year and have some questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Teaching portfolio. I'm putting together my teaching portfolio, and have watched many videos on what to include in one, but never one that explains how I should present it in a interview... do I show them page by page, kinda like a PowerPoint? Or give them the binder and let them look for themselves? Do I keep it afterwards or will they? My social anxiety has made nervous for this part of the interview, on top of the general nervousness haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I'm Jewish and observe all of the holidays. There's a LOT of holidays, in which I must take work off so I can attend services and observe the holiday. Primarily in the fall. I haven't looked into exact dates (I will before interviews), but I'll probably have to take around 6 days off beginning sometime in September and ending in October. Same deal in the spring, but not as many days, for other holidays. Should I bring this up point blank in interviews? Ask how they'll accommodate me? I'm very nervous about this, and am unsure how I should approach it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Any other advice or tips would be more than welcomed!! Whether in general or about portfolios or anything. Thank you so much if you've read this far.",

        "body": "Hello, I\u2019m not sure if I really belong in this group, because I work for a social services agency and teach adult learners but I was hoping some teachers may have some advice for me. I train the new employees at my agency on a variety of of topics including nursing assistant skills, documentation, crisis deescalation, money management, emergency response and safety, and much more. The new employees will be direct support professionals, providing hands on care to disabled adults. They spend one to two months with me although not every person comes to every single class. I am having this chronic issue in which students will literally sleep all day. These are ADULTS. People will boldly sleep in their chairs, and not even try to hide it. I understand that these are adults who often work multiple jobs/have kids and thus are tired, however if a nurse/teacher/social worker was caught sleeping during training, they would be reprimanded and possibly terminated for multiple infractions. I try my hardest to make the content fun and engaging, but not everything can be an activity or a game. And even when I make it an activity or a game, people will put in the minimum effort or not finish it. To make things more challenging, 99% of the people in the classes are English as a second language learners, who can barely read English, so it\u2019s not like I can give them reading assignments instead. Often times, the people who sleep in class don\u2019t actually learn the skills, and when they go out to their worksites, they make mistakes and I get blamed. Any tips on increasing engagement and keeping people awake?",

I'm a 9th-grade teacher who matriculated with her students from 8th grade (taught all of them in the 8th grade). \n\nSince this is my final year teaching, I thought I'd go all out and give my students a small (free, non-monetary) gift of a card with a small lyric from one of the many songs I've listened to this past year. Each one would be handwritten and personalized to each student. As in, no two students would get the same lyric or the same note about their impact on me as a teacher and the class environment. Yes, even the semi-difficult ones. \n\nI know it's my last year (so why do I care?), but I don't want any backlash from any of the parents about a personalized card because of \"crossing boundaries.\" I will admit I'm a metal-head, but none of the songs I picked are about killing or maiming or whatever people assume metal-heads are like. All of the songs are by Gojira or Jinjer, and each lyric would be based on the child's personality from what I've observed, and none would be negative at all. \n\nAs a parent, student, or another teacher, would this raise any red flags? I know the intent is one thing, but the impact is something I want to keep an open mind about. Let me know your thoughts and thank you in advance!",

        "body": "Today, I received an email about disciplining one of my students from a parent who thinks the sun shines out of her child's butt. Basically, she's angry that I told her child to shut her mouth over telling her to be quiet. As if I didn't always say to be quiet 10+ times before I told her to shut her mouth and to stop yelling at another student. She says that she's upset that I spoke to her child that way and honestly I'm SOOO over this \"my child is an innocent victim in everything \" view that parents seem to have. \n\nI have previously spoken to this parent about their child's behavior in class and always got \"I'll speak with her\" with the student coming in the next day doing the same shit. \n\nAfter months of this and then, her LoVeLy child pushes another child's head into the water while going to the bathroom. She has been talked to several times about her child and I was just fed up with the \"I'll talk to her\" when I know she's not being talked to or disciplined. So I sent her child to the office and called the mom to tell her that her child pushed another child's head in the water and I have called her several times about her behavior and attitude problem. That it's unacceptable and she will for now on be sent to the office or out of my classroom each time she puts her hands on another student or talks to others disrespectfully. \n\nShe pulls the \"MY child would never do that and maybe I just need to take her out of your class\" So I told her \"that's fine with me but the other teachers aren't going to allow her to hit and verbally assault others either\" She hung up of course. Frankly, I wish she was able to move the child out of my classroom. \n\nNow I know full well that I am a very direct person living in the south and beating around the bush is seen as polite and telling someone bluntly is not. \n\nThis child's behavior has not changed at all. She continues to do the same crap every day and goes home to make herself the victim and everyone else the bully when in fact she is a bully. But given mom's reaction, mom is probably a bully as well. \n\nThe mom says she \"doesn't the way I talk to her daughter and neither does her daughter \" She is angry because I told her child to shut her mouth when she got into a screaming match with another student. And I pulled her into the hall to talk to her YET AGAIN about her disrespectful attitude and the way she talks to people. \n\nI'm sorry, but there are only so many times I can say be quiet and stop yelling before it's shut your mouth. It seems to be the only thing that gets her to shut up. I hate having to be rude, but there's a point where parents need to STOP allowing their kids to run around and play the victim and start asking themselves \"why does my child continue to get in trouble for the same thing?\" I'm not saying it's right that I told this child to shut her mouth, but honestly, if your child only responds to people when they have to get disrespectful with them for them to even hear you, then there's a problem.\n\nI just want to know, when did parents start believing children over adults? At this point, I feel like I need a body cam latched to every child to prove to their parents their children aren't saints.",

I then said, \u201chey you guys, it is extremely disrespectful to talk while someone is presenting information. This is not charting time, this is class time and we are here to learn. You can discuss your ideas amongst eachother once the lesson is completed, and once I\u2019m done talking.\u201d They looked at me like they were confused. I am so sick of the disrespect these kids have now of days. Now we just blatantly talk over teachers? I\u2019m so done, and can\u2019t wait for this year to be over! It\u2019s kinda of like fine! Continue to receive F\u2019s on your papers\u2026 this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. However, it was shocking how long it took them to stop talking this time.

Because of this, my Monday groups are nearly a month behind the other days just because if someone's not calling out to tattle, there's drama about what someone just tattled about (between them not me).

Teachers in my district don\u2019t achieve tenure until the first day of their fifth year. \n\nI am moving out of state next year, and am hearing several different things about whether or not to wait it out to get tenure. \n\nLeaving would mean moving this summer and starting the job hunt soon. I don\u2019t plan on going back into teaching in a classroom right away as I also have a background in public health. I\u2019ll be looking for Health Educator Specialist or Patient Engagement type jobs. I love teaching and I may go back to it one day, but the school and system right now is not putting me in a good place.\n\nI\u2019m being told that leaving before achieving tenure would put a \u201cblack mark\u201d or a big question mark on my record, which could prevent me from getting a job- teaching or not. \n\nAn alternative would be to stay until next year, get tenure, then take a leave after September. What\u2019s holding me back from that is how poor my mental health has been, and the idea of having to go back seems horrible and daunting. I have a history of severe depression and hospitalization. It would also mean delaying my job search. But maybe I should just suck it up and come back for a month?\n\nI wanted to hear other people\u2019s input, so any feedback would be great.

One of the biggest issues was students having side conversations. I'd try and get them to focus back on me and it'd last about a minute before they were back on it. I was being walked all over and it felt terrible. \n\nHow do I get them to actually listen and keep listening to me? \n\nAnd all of this at the same time, I have a dislocated knee that's causing me problems so I can't circulate around the room as well or stand behind talking kids and a Hamilton/Burr dynamic with my partner student teacher. They walked in today with barely any prep and rocked it, while I worked my ass off for the last month and it was awful. \n\nI need to do better and I need it to be better tomorrow, but I don't know how. Please help.",

Currently I teach 4th but hold a special Ed certification, too. \n\nCurrent school: public, Title 1, has lots of issues, and I absolutely hate the new administration. I\u2019ve already told them I\u2019m not returning. \n\nI\u2019m still interviewing across schools. However, my most recent interview I\u2019m pretty sure is going to offer me a job. I absolutely love the concept of the school, the environment, and the staff seems pretty chill. \n\nThis new school: it\u2019s technically considered a private school. Public schools send their high support needs students with severe and profound disabilities here (I think a few are in the milder side). I\u2019m talking intellectual disabilities. Lots of students who utilize chairs for mobility, those who don\u2019t use words to communicate. \n\nThis is truly my area. I do several programs with a non-profit that supports the same community and I love it. \n\nMy big question: what is the major differences? Pros? Cons? What I know so far is I would no longer have a union, I would have a company funded 401k instead of state retirement, and they operate on a 12 month schedule which would add an additional 37 to the usual 180.  \n\nHas anyone switched to and from one or the other?\n\nThanks y\u2019all!",

        "body": "So, last Friday, as a student teacher who has had absolutely no trouble so far in the class room, I get pulled aside randomly to discuss a comment I made to a student earlier that day. The student in question is a 5th grader who was sent to school in a Misfits t shirt. The shirt itself was not vulgar in any fashion. It was simply their name and logo, and was in my opinion tame. This is a child who has struggled behaviorally in the past, and in seeking to make a connection with him, I said that I recognized and liked his shirt. He explained to me that he hadn\u2019t listened to them much, but it was his mom\u2019s favorite band. Long story short, my cooperating teacher, who is in her fifties, Christian, and I assume conservative to some degree was curious about what the shirt meant, so she looked up their lyrics. They were violent and vulgar, and she was understandably appalled. I told her I get it but was only trying to compliment a shirt and was not trying to endorse any violent lyrics or imagery associated with the band. Being that the student said he wasn\u2019t even interested in them and it was his mother\u2019s influence, I saw it as even more of a nonissue. Am I in the wrong here?",

My career prospects are so unsatisfying that I dread coming into the office every day. The pay is pretty good for what I do, but its simply draining me and I think the field is not for me.\n\nI have a mental health condition that is prone to flair up due to stress. I am also 23 and am not the best at confrontation. Because of these factors, I am not sure I will be able to hack it as a teacher. I am worried I'll get in front of a class and the troublesome students will sniff out my \"weakness\" and simply roll over me. And of course, the talk of the mass teacher exodus from horrid work conditions scares me to death, along with the bad pay.\n\nEven with these fears, I think I would love teaching. All I want to do for a career is to help others, and especially those who had it worse than me growing up. I would pursue middle-highschool education and specialize either in mathematics or history/polysci. I also come from a family of teachers, so I think its just in my blood.\n\nAny advice or input? I think I would be so proud to call myself a teacher, but I want to pursue this if I can truly make a difference and help others. Thanks!",

        "title": "School Sucks For Boys",
        "body": "I have a hypothesis.\n\nAt the first day of school, give each student an assignment: have them write a generic sentence in their handwriting and color in a picture with some detail. I believe you'd be able to tell how the rest of the year is going to go just by that one assignment.\n\nI know it's a stereotype that boys are more physical than girls, but I think that's kind of a misnomer. Let's go back to the handwriting/coloring assignment. I guarantee if you look through everything they turned in, the girls are going to have way better handwriting on average and their coloring pages will look neat and carefully colored in the lines. The boys will probably be a lot more mixed, and I'd bet more than half are gonna be scribbled and with far less legible handwriting. Even if parents aren't spending more time teaching their daughters how to write neatly, girls seem to pick it up a lot more naturally, and that tells us everything. Girls are more likely to be concerned with little details and will try to make everything look right and proper in it's place. Boys on the other hand seem more prone to dreaming. To use some handy philosophical terms, boys are like (Platonic) form and girls are like matter. Girls do well when everything is done according to a set procedure in a controlled environment while boys do better when they're allowed to engage with the world at their own pace. This is all very general and not accurate for everyone, but I think it illustrates something really important.\n\nBoys spend their whole lives being rigidly managed, more often than not by adult women. They can never be themselves and are constantly forced to accommodate people who find their natural selves too offensive and uncivilized. They can't tell jokes that they actually find funny, can't get up out of their seats for a few seconds to stretch, can't go to the bathroom without raising their hands and asking someone. Everyone is made completely dependent yet the artificiality of the situation also breeds loneliness. How can you really socialize and get to know someone when you can't even be yourself? Society has become overly atomized on one hand and overly bureaucratized on the other.\n\nBoys are told from a young age that everything they do a girl can do equally well or better. At the same time, boys are made aware that there are tons of things they'll never be able to do as well as a girl. Girls are always lifted up while boys are pushed into the dirt every time they show an ounce of pride. A boy who thinks he's good at something will always be laughed at or met with snark when a girl does better than him, and he's just supposed to take that and internalize it.\n\nSchool is designed for girls who embody every old-fashioned \"girly\" stereotype. You're supposed to be quiet, selflessly agreeable, and without an ounce of autonomy. The natural leaders find this dynamic miserable and become the class clowns. The kids (of any gender) who excel in school are setting themselves up for a career as a professional doormat. In a slightly less contrived environment, the real world, they find their skills completely out of place.\n\nI don't believe boys \"learn with their bodies\" or \"learn by roughhousing\" like some say; I think the roughhousing is a natural product of being understimulated for 8 hours straight. They can't move around, can't talk to their friends, and let's be honest, 90% of them couldn't care less about the assignments. They're at school because they have to be there, even when the curriculum is lobotomized more and more every year to accommodate the student's unwillingness to engage with it.\n\nFinally, boys get no sympathy, and that's sad.\n\nMost boys are growing up without a father in the picture and with few positive male role models. They're increasingly isolated, increasingly drawn to fringe communities. American colleges and universities now enroll roughly six women for every four men, and this disparity is even wider in lower income and POC communities. This is a travesty! For all the \"women in STEM\" talk, there's little said about this massive inequality that goes unnoticed. These young men are falling further and further behind each year and the response is almost always condescending. Men were in charge forever right? Them feeling chronically useless and directionless is only fair right? It's sad, and men are always blamed for their own shortcomings when that's never the case for other disadvantaged groups. Young men internalize this inferiority and gravitate to the only people building them up, which is currently people like Andrew Tate unfortunately. I don't think it's insignificant how he of all people has become the favorite hero of middle school boys.\n\nThere is so much more to this subject, but it's something that's been on my mind a lot recently. Is our society failing boys or are boys just born to fail? It's something we need to ask ourselves.",

But even without doing so, the grades are seriously unacceptable (only one kid aced the quiz while at least 4 failed it) and the general attitude of not caring is driving me nuts at this point. I generally don\u2019t take things like this seriously but it feels almost like they\u2019re giving me a hard time and forcing me to overextend myself (also because I\u2019m being held accountable by the school) while they exert no effort whatsoever.

        "body": "Hi all\n\nDo you ever feel like you spend most of your time accommodating the biggest needs in the classroom? And therefore the rest of the class misses out on something?\n\nI teach elementary art and most of my 18 classes have at least two students with significant needs. Often it\u2019s more than two. I\u2019m usually by myself in the room. I have vocalized this to LBS1s and admin. Unfortunately they have little control - it\u2019s almost impossible to get 1:1 or aides in my district. Or they give me more accommodations to try, but this is always a compromise with what the rest of the class needs. I can\u2019t dig out extra fidgets or special tools while I\u2019m trying to show the rest of the class the project. I can\u2019t spend all my prep modifying the lesson for one child. There is only one of me. Plus I\u2019m slowly learning if I keep handing the \u201cbig need\u201d special things they just become more demanding. Or expect special privileges, like getting to play instead of doing some version of the assignment.\n\nFor example, I have a class with a student who can\u2019t handle paint. And he rips apart the room if he doesn\u2019t get what he want. So therefore that class can\u2019t paint. He has autism. Another class has a handful of students with ADHD, so instead of helping students learn to weave I am putting out bigger fires like stopping students from hitting stools against the wall. It\u2019s so frustrating because I could do so much more with the other students. \n\nAnd I\u2019m a person who supports taking care of kids with special needs. My brother has Down Syndrome, so I\u2019m sympathetic. But I\u2019m also not a superhero and can\u2019t manage 5 things at once. \n\nI\u2019m a veteran teacher with distinguished rating, but I\u2019m losing my mind here. \n\nUuuggghhhh.",

She tells me to go and intervene a minor thing that doesn't need to be intervened. \n\nI did it anyway but it doesn't sit right with me.

She goes and manages her own students but tells me to manage some other class's students! WTF! \n\n\nCan someone help me how to deal with these stupid inconveniences? How do I navigate this?

        "body": "I\u2019m so tired of the politics involved with teaching. The having to treat everyone \u201cfairly\u201d, the lack of accountability for students AND parents, the fact that we\u2019re lowering the bar for teachers instead of improving working conditions and salaries to entice qualified people to actually want to do the job. I\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was in first grade. I went to a technical high school to fast track my education and gain some experience before college. I was the first person in my family to go to college and graduate. And now, 4 years in, I\u2019m absolutely miserable.\n\nThis past week I reached my limit. I have a policy in my class (7th grade ELA) that if students are caught cheating on a test or talking during a test, it\u2019s an automatic zero, no questions asked. This policy is outlined in my class syllabus that goes home at the beginning of the year that students AND parents both sign and then it gets returned to me. We review this expectation before every test.\n\nLast week, I caught two students cheating and talking during a test and gave them both 0\u2019s. One of them got very upset and emailed me asking why he got a 0 and adamantly denying what I saw with my own eyes. I explain the situation, what I saw, the fact that he agreed to this policy at the beginning of the year, and that I will not be changing his grade.\n\nThis student then starts emailing me and harassing me for two days straight. Sending me emails at night saying things like \u201cyou gave me that grade and you\u2019re going to change it because you know I wasn\u2019t cheating\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m starting to think you have a problem with me\u201d, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t take this much effort to convince you I wasn\u2019t cheating.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO FILE A REPORT AGAINST YOU\u201d (yes, all capital letters), \u201cyou can talk to admin or whoever you need to talk to. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m tired of all the disrespect at this point.\u201d\n\nAdmins response? \u201cJust let him retake it. It isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d How is it not worth it to teach kids accountability? To teach them that they can\u2019t talk to people like that; especially not their teachers? To teach them that throwing a temper tantrum doesn\u2019t just get them what they want? They\u2019re literally doing nothing to support me in this situation which completely undermines me to my students. \n\nI\u2019m just so over it. I don\u2019t get paid enough to be blatantly disrespected by a 12 year old. Or to be this miserable. Or to be so physically and emotionally drained at the end of the day that I have nothing left to give to my infant son. Is it like this everywhere? Do I just need to change professions or is there hope? Does anyone else feel like this?",

I know it be would be awful to find out a school representative was taking about our kids that way.  \n\nI\u2019d like some honest options on if this is acceptable? Normalized? I\u2019m sure teachers need to talk about students to other teachers sometimes. But I believe a psychologist should be trusted not to share details about a student with no one except parents and the current teacher/principal.

Honestly I always knew that I'd fare better with younger children (I enjoyed working with the younger ones more) and I love the job (it's in the private sphere so you can imagine the difference in pay and benefits), but making such an abrupt change with no prior training scares me. \n\nI am very young, I don't have children on my own and my experience with kids that young (one to three years) is very limited. Heck, I have no idea how to change diapers! I feel like I definitely should have more experience with this. However I was assured that my current education is enough and that there will always be two more experienced teachers alongside me to help me with everything (it's small nursery, ten children and three teachers). \n\nWhat is your professional opinion about this possible career change? Do you think I'll be able to transition smoothly from being (almost high school) teacher's assistant to nursery teacher? Do you have any tips on what I should read/study to prepare myself better?",

        "body": "Behavior at my elementary school is reaching fever pitch. In my grade, there's at least 1 fight a day. I get cursed out by a student (and give a disrespect detention for similar things) about 3x a day. My grade-level group has done everything: positive behavior management systems, negative too, tally wars, individual store points (+ and -), bribing with candy/chips, calling parents, calling coaches, Tier II and III plans, behavior folders, sticky note warnings, class bean jar wars, the list goes on. \n\nAdmin put us on full lockdown, no student transitions, silent lunch, reverse suspensions, and behavior got even worse as students were triggered by changes to their routines and the tightening down. Admin asks us 'what can we do to help?' meanwhile I'm a first year teacher shrugging, like, I don't know. I really don't. The 18 year veteran teacher doesn't either, she broke down crying in my room last week. \n\n**Last week, a student popped off on me 10 minutes into the day for not giving him a bag of chips (he didn't earn them according to our behavior system) and said: \"Shut the fuck up you dumb fucking bitch. You whore! You ugly fucking ho! That's why no one likes you, you dumb fucking bitch. Ugly ass whore! Asshole bitch! Fuck you! Die bitch!\"**\n\nI gotta be real, I laughed out loud. He just kept going (more than I wrote above). I mean, I saw a student visibly check the time. It was funny. He got one day ISS. Admin pulled me into a meeting to say that it was inappropriate of me to laugh at him. I asked if it was inappropriate of him to curse me out like that. They shrugged and said: **\"You should have let him cool off, not sent him down to ISS immediately. Sometimes they come in a little amped up, he should have gotten a timeout first.\"** Completely disregards the fact that he's done this 3x in the past. He's not SPED, no 504 Plan, he just curses a lot and disrespects teachers, because he knows he can get a little slap on the wrist timeout and nothing more. \n\nI don't know what they want. **A student filmed a video threatening to kill me, I was never informed by admin, they never checked in on me.** I had to hear about it from the para who found the video on the student's computer. That student got 2 days ISS. No restorative circle (which my school preaches, but obviously doesn't practice) before they came back into class. No apology, no one even informed me. \n\nI feel like the accountability for all behavior is on me, and when I'm calling my master teacher or admin begging for help because a student is calling me a 'cunt' in class, I get a \"I'm in a meeting\" text and a promise to come visit my classroom that never happens. Principal has come into my classroom ONE time this year. VP came in only TWO times. \n\n**I'm in a union but I don't even know how to express the situation, or if its something my teacher union can help me with. Any ideas? Or is this normal and I just gotta deal until I eventually quit the profession...because this is not sustainable.**",

        "body": "I ask this, because clearly the recent California budget has come out and once again PROP 98 is squeezing the discretionary budget to a standstill. That being said, despite approximately 45% of the budget being dedicated to the state-education, dissatisfaction for the state of education in California increased from 35% in 2020 to 44% in 2021. Moreover, teachers are still finding it extremely difficult to afford living in California. \n\nWith a majority of the funds from the amount allocated to education going towards pensions, do you think that:\n\n1) You would be willing to sacrifice you pension for a $15,000 raise\n\n2) Do you think having higher wages will improve your quality of life\n\n3) How satisfied are you with the quality of services provided to you by CALPERS\n\nThank you for your input!",

I work for a pretty good middle school with really supportive administration and colleagues, which I am very grateful for. The weeks have been challenging, but rewarding overall. Obviously, starting halfway through the year comes with many many problems and difficulties. I am proud of myself for landing this opportunity, nonetheless. \n\nThere is one student who has made life and work particularly stressful. This student has made it their personal mission to break me down, and it is getting exhausting. I am generally an optimistic person, but it becomes very frustrating when this student is always telling me how much they hate me, and how horrible I am as a teacher. They make comments about my body, my personality, and my physical health condition. \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t let it get to me. I mean, the kid is 13. But it is becoming really hard to hear those things day after day, week after week, with absolutely no consequences for this student at all when I report them. This student has, in the past, harmed teachers and destroyed entire classrooms when they become triggered. Maybe it\u2019s the lack of experience in me, but I don\u2019t really feel safe in my own classroom (not that the room feels like my own anyway after coming in this late in the year). \n\nI feel pathetic about it. Every morning, I am waking up way before my alarm (around 2am) and throwing up, shaking, crying, and hyperventilating thinking about dealing with this student. On the other hand, I have gotten only the kindest comments from other students, who all love me and my class. But I feel like there is only so many personal attacks any person can take before they crack, and I am past that point. \n\nAny advice on how to either deal with this student in a better way or preserve my mental health?",

        "body": "Hey all, posting on behalf of a close friend who doesn't have reddit. She has been teaching at a Pre-K for a few years and loves it, but would like to start moving into K-12 (is not certified). \n\nShe has a bachelor's in Fine Arts, but GPA is too low to for certification. The current thought process is to obtain an MAT that leads to licensure (as opposed to another bachelor's). \n\nHowever, she's not yet positive whether she'd like to go into Art Education (for which she has relevant coursework completed) or general elementary education. \n\nCurrent understanding is 1. Take Praxis Core, 2. Get into an MAT program, 3. Graduate and take Praxis II\n\nHoping to get a sense check - does this seem like the most efficient way forward? She really wants to be a teacher, but also wants to avoid unnecessary degrees or tests.\n\nAlso, it seems like if she started in elementary and later wanted to teach at higher grades, she'd have to take a different Praxis II and get certified again - is that correct?\n\nThank you all \ud83d\ude4f",

The use of scholar is ridiculous and is removing the meaning of the word. It is not helping and is just by passing behavior by saying \u201cthey had a hard life so we if we lie to them and call them future scholars they will get there\u201d. Stop it. Stop pretending these things work.\n\nYes. Kids have shitty lives. I get it. But what we can\u2019t do is coddle them into oblivion and lie to them. Why lie to them? Tell them their lives are not great and hopefully they will want to get out knowing their is a better future. By pretending we tell students their lives can\u2019t get better.",

It is generally met with \u201cThat\u2019s not class appropriate language, make that clear to them\u201d and I can agree with this fundamental philosophy. \n\nHowever, what I dislike is when it turns into a discourse regarding the validity of the usage at all. I\u2019ve noticed on multiple occasions non-Black teachers expressing a \u201cif I can\u2019t use it, no one should be allowed\u201d perspective, and this disturbs me. I guess because it makes me feel as though certain teachers prioritize their personal convictions over the cultural differences between their students and themselves, and this makes me concerned for their overall demeanor towards Black students. \n\nIt worries me to see teachers asserting their views over those which they don\u2019t understand, because it makes me wonder where else they may overstep their boundaries with Black students in the classroom. I worry that Black students and culture is not taken seriously by some non-Black teachers, and how this can create conflict within their teacher-student relationships. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting from this post. I guess I\u2019m just voicing my anxieties as a Black teacher in an urban district regarding how non-Black teachers treat students who look like mine. Am I making sense ? Do I sound crazy ? \n\nI\u2019ve noticed covert racism on this sub before and idk, it bothers me, to say the least. I worry sometimes that there are not enough critical Black voices on this sub to counteract what at times feels like a bastion of White liberalism..",

They reply \"nah we're gonna keep calling you white boy\". \"Yall fuck with us we can get you back\". I have no idea what this means but it's clearly racial in nature. And it's a group of about 6 boys that continue to do this. They get others to either laugh or join in on it.\n\nI've told administrators and their response is always downplaying it as \"a term of endearment\" or they encourage me to issue counseling chits \"if it bothers you that much\", which to the students mean absolutely nothing. After repeated attempts to contact parents with no answers whatsoever, I'm about ready to give up. If I try to assert more dominance I know I won't win because these kids will spin it and make me look like the bad guy. Any advice?",

A couple of students falsely accused me of saying things I never have and after an \"investigation\" the result was my termination of probationary service and license. I'm 100% sure it's because I don't have tenure yet. This is my second year of teaching.\n\nI intend to call the Union (UFT) on Monday but I'm really curious to know now if that means I can no longer teach in NYC?\n\nI'm confused because I don't know what a NYC teaching \"license\" is? \nI have my NYS Initial Certificate and it shows active on the TEACH account.\nDoes that mean I can still work in NYC Public schools?\n\nAnyway, thanks for any information you guys might have. \n\nEnjoy the rest of your day!",

        "title": "Should I leave my current school?",
        "body": "So, it's March and as I look towards the end of this school year and summer break I am starting to ponder on whether I should stay at my current school or not. I work at a K-8 that has departmentalized classes starting at 3rd grade (I teach within a departmentalized grade), and this is one of the key factors in my decision, I think. The pros and cons of staying?  \n\nPros: \n1.The school is just about a 10 to 15 minute drive from where I live. It's close and convenient in a neighborhood that is low income and in need but that I do respond to.\n\n2. The school community is alright aside from a few things which I will mention in the cons. I have rapport with my students from last year (last year was my first year at my current school), obviously with my students this year, but I'm also just maybe the most popular teacher in the school so I have rapport with a lot of the school community. Despite the issue that I'll mention, I've grown a bond between myself and the student community, at least. \n\n3. I teach a grade level and subject which is very good for me, with some caveats.\n\n\n4. Last year is my last year before my preliminary teaching credential expires. I'll have to start induction next year, (hopefully the 1 year path is possible) and it seems to me like it would be easier if I tried to do it within a context that had stability to it. Moving to a new school and ALL that that entails would be a curveball for me, plus I don't know how the 1 year path attempt would work if I would need proof of at least two exceptional years from my supervisors and If I leave I wouldn't be under the same roof of said supervisors any more.\n\nCons:\n1. Ultimately, I think I just don't vibe with the departmentalization at my grade level. I've worked with two different partner teachers and unfortunately I haven't vibed with any of them. We more or less hated each others' guts last year, had different ideologies (this had a nasty effect on consistency for students) and now this year with my new partner teacher... we just don't vibe. This whole model of teaching does rely on good relationships and teamwork with your partner teacher so that it doesn't feel at the very least awkward and I don't want to rely on that so much.\n\nI don't think the departmentalization is good for students' consistency. Hell, I think students from K-6 probably benefit a lot from having one main teacher but out students have two main teachers plus a lot of other electives and this lack of consistency really makes itself felt in everything from the teaching schedules the student behavior and etc. I don't think so many transitions and that such a lack of consistency is great for our students, and I don't want to share them if I'm not a middle school teacher. \n\nThere's also a sense of competition between the partner teachers and myself, and students inevitably compare. There's a lot to do with instructional time, consistency in everything, student behavior, relationships with colleagues, that I don't necessarily like all that much.\n\n2. The curriculum sucks. We're given a curriculum but none of the teachers really like or even respect it, it is overrated, lacking, AND dense and complicated at the same time. This requires me to have to come up with everything basically because I'd just rather do something else. This takes too much work. \n\n3. There are some staff I don't gel with, the feelings mutual. Big drama happened between myself and this other person to the point where I had to request for the person to stop working with me personally and to never talk to me again... the request was thankfully approved due to the evidence of various incidents that I presented but I also don't really gel with my partner teacher and another teacher at another grade level who does seem to gel with the people I don't get along with, they all do apparently. I don't want to have to deal with this.\n\nHonestly, if it wasn't so close and convenient to where I live and if my credential was already cleared, I'd leave. \n\nThere's a last factor, and that's that I basically live with symptoms that at various turns either mirror those seen in things like both Bipolar disorder and some autoimmune diseases, and that makes teaching and functioning day to day hard as it stands already. My next school would have to be a brilliant choice.\n\nIf anything I'd like my next school to have a friendly community amongst staff, not be micromanaging or hard pressing with workloads (not that my current school really is), and I wouldn't want to be departmentalized and have to share my students. \n\nSigh.",

She has pretty clear favoritism and is generally unpopular as an AP because of this and because she\u2019s extremely nitpicky and sometimes rude to the staff who aren\u2019t some of her favorites. \nAnyway- she regularly posts on Facebook out to dinner or at parties with teachers and office staff. There\u2019s a core group of 8ish people on our staff that she spends time with. As her former teammate I do know for sure that she drinks and gossips with them as well. \nAs one of her not favorites- it makes me feel super weird.

During my 20s, I was a military officer for 5 years and separated by choice in 2018. \n\nIn the military, when there were breaches of conduct, there were punitive measures taken against the offending party. Restricting time off, extra duty, reduction of pay, etc. The consequences for missteps were swift and appropriately harsh. It\u2019s for this reason, that I do not blame most administrators for the discipline problems so many of us see in our classrooms and hallways. If there\u2019s no parental buy-in, school disciplinary measures mean nothing. Admin are largely toothless in the face of pitch-fork toting, enabling parents that blow up school board meetings, so by extension, so are teachers. \n\nWhen I write up students for serious behavior issues, it isn\u2019t because I believe it will result in a change of behavior or any other positive outcome. It\u2019s to show my bosses that I was not complicit with the behavior so when the student finally cracks and does something felonious, I have a paper trail to protect me.

It can be physically draining and if a student is aggressive, it can be risky.\n\nIf we are ever going to catch up on special education hiring, we need to offer them more money. And not some small token amount. I am talking double pay. A free college degree and $100K to start.",

        "body": "I'll keep it as brief as possible.\n\nI am an overworked para/after school director working 60+ hours a week for unlivable pay (less than 30k/year).\n\nI had wanted to finish the year, but I'm literally feeling physical repercussions from the level of stress I've been going through, and I'm starting to feel like I need an out. Ideally, what I'd like to do is switch from this absolutely chaotic and untenable dynamic to potentially being a supply-permanent emergency sub for a classroom that needs a replacement teacher until the end of the year. I would imagine in March, there are probably quite a few openings. I like teaching, just not being treated the way I am here with these uncommonly difficult and extreme conditions.\n\nI feel this may be what is truly best for me, due to those kind of subs still having way more pay than what I have right now. I would have more reasonable work hours that won't negatively impact my health to this current level I am experiencing, and it could potentially get my foot in the door to a permanent teaching position while I finish my online school work to get my degree.\n\nHow feasible is it, that I could be released from my current contract (even though I am \"just a para\", I *did* sign one at the beginning of the year) at my current school as a para, and be allowed to transfer to a different school as a supply/long-term sub? (There are several openings I intend to apply for) Is it better to stay in the same county-system, or move to a different county/district? If it's a different district, would they help you in breaking your contract if they wanted you badly enough? What steps should I take? Should I go to a doctor to discuss these physical things that are going on, so that they can write a letter that heavily suggests it is in my best interest to not work 60-70 hours a week, be allowed to be released from those duties, and allowed to move to new and more reasonable duties at a different school?\n\nBetween the physical strain going on, waking up with chest pains and random spontaneous bouts of vomiting this week, not really sure I want to go another 11 weeks and find out what else can start happening. It's been a progression, as it originally was just chest pains and headaches, and has now evolved into gastrointestinal distress and other unsavory symptoms that genuinely make it hard to function in a personal or professional capacity.\n\nI know that breaking contract is a big no-no, but, for someone who is a para-pro, how much would this negatively reflect on my record if I go about it tactfully and carefully (such as with a doctor assessment involved to corroborate the effects of the stress from this position and its responsibilities on my health)?",

She is hard to avoid because she's everywhere. She is great with the kids, but she enjoys socializing to the point where it interferes with her doing her job. She will leave her kids unattended in order to socialize. She plays fast &amp; loose with the truth, and few of us who work closely with her believe much of what she says. She has, however, formed deep bonds with the principal. Kelly has had run-ins with many people and gets her feelings hurt quite easily. She disappears for long periods of time when she gets upset. She often runs to the principal and tattles on whomever she's disagreed with &amp; the principal usually sides with Kelly. She happens to also be gay.\n\nJoy is very quiet and almost timid &amp; shy. She is a very private person. Although we work in the same room, I know very little about her personal life, opinions or beliefs. When she does speak, her words are very well thought out. She is amazing with her kids. She is very intuitive, anticipating the kids' needs. She sees things that need to be done &amp; quietly takes care of them without being asked. She likes to get the job done. She socializes very little. She tends to be laser-focused on accomplishing whatever task she is doing, especially when working with students.\n\nKelly's and Joy's schedules rarely overlap. They do not have breaks at the same time nor lunch at the same time. None of their duty times are the same. Over the course of the day, they may be around each other 15-20 minutes total, if you add it all up.\n\nRecently, Kelly has become obsessed with getting Joy to talk to her and, since Joy hasn't become Kelly's buddy, Kelly has begun spreading things about Joy. Kelly has come to believe that Joy (who is extremely quiet, shy &amp; private) does not socialize with her because she is gay. One day this week, Kelly left her students to confront Joy, who was eating lunch in the breakroom. She accused Joy of bullying her (by not talking to her) because she is gay. When Joy sought out another teacher (because she wanted a witness), Kelly ran off to sob to the principal. \n\nThe principal has heard both of their stories &amp; has said that they can't both be true.\nJoy feels that Kelly verbally assaulted &amp; harassed her &amp; now fears coming back to work &amp; being around Kelly. Joy asked that the principal file an incident report &amp; give her a copy. \n\nI've had a run-ins with Kelly myself, and I started keeping a detailed Incident log, just in case she ever tries to make up a story and \"tattle\" on me. The principal assures me that, as a certified teacher,  I don't have to worry... I'm unsure.",

To me special education seems like a calling within a calling. I think for subject teachers like me you get drawn to the subject then drawn to teaching not to special ed teaching. I just really loathe being a para right now and it is ruining my desire for teaching. I don't like having any control over the pacing and what is taught in the classroom, nor do I like making minimum wage for performing an extremely emotionally draining job. Tech salaries make me pissed off even more. I'm thinking this might be remedied by becoming a teacher, it will be my own classroom, I'll make more money, etc. I don't know though. I think they should do away with alternative teacher certification altogether and require all teachers to get a degree in education.

This is awesome because we can encourage kids who would struggle in high level math classes to take the slower paced classes, change the pace, add more practice and essential skills and make math attainable for more kids.   \n\n\nWell, our school has a huge attendance and failure rate issues. Almost none (like 5%-10%) of our juniors and sophomores are on track for graduation. So we are going to offer new super easy math classes that ANYONE can pass even if they only come to school one day a week. We can just teach them elementary or middle school math they already know and give them math credits and send them into the world. These kids are already going to do bad on ACTs so there's no point in preparing them for it, or college or technical college admission or anything useless like that.  \n\n\nAnd since we have a hiring freeze, we can't hire teachers for that new program, so we are eliminating the remedial options. Now every kid will be in the same geometry and I'll have to make the curriculum slow and easy so every student has a chance to pass. My principal said to eliminate proofs from geometry to start.

The kid who sits next to my desk had been in school for 3 days prior while sick without a mask, hence the assumption that it was covid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love any advice or input.",

        "body": "I am a 2nd-year social studies teacher and this is technically my first full year teaching 5-8th grade. I had parent-teacher conferences last week. I had a parent come in and tell me that her kids are not retaining anything. That they remember the information up to the test and after that, they forget it. She told me that she will ask them questions about my content (social studies) and they aren\u2019t able to answer them. Her kids are A students so this conversation came out of the left field. She said that it was a moot point, I am not engaging, and they have learned nothing from me. I told her numerous times that I do more than lecture to try to keep it engaging and not boring. I have my classes complete projects, virtual field trips, CSI cases, etc. However; it was not enough and she accused me of not caring about my subject or teaching it. She was also upset that they have been bringing home classwork to complete. That after school is family time, not school time. I have NEVER told my students that they have to take classwork home. I give time in class for them to complete it and I even extend due dates for kids who need extra time. Her kids are normally the first ones done and they get free time.  She was also upset that I do not have my students debate topics like Roe v. Wade. They are 10-13 years old, this is not an appropriate topic for me to teach and that is not even the period I teach. A lot more was said but the gist of it is that I am a horrible teacher, I\u2019m not engaging, and her children learned nothing from me. \n\nThis conversation lasted nearly an hour. Being told for the first time by a parent that I did not prepare their kids for high school was heartbreaking. I was able to hold my emotions in for about 15-20 minutes but when the parent did not stop berating me I did cry. It was/is embarrassing and I hate that I allowed a person to do that to me. I put a lot of time and passion into my subject and students and to be told that I wasted her kids' education was hard to hear. Looking back now, I should have gotten up and contacted admin. I believe when she started this conversation, her goal was to berate me. She wasn\u2019t yelling but her tone and voice level were close. I think I just froze and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I know I\u2019m too sensitive and I hope with more experience that will change. My main goal for typing this out is that I will be less upset about it. I feel like I failed her kids and that is a horrible feeling.",

Some districts in TX are starting teachers with 1 year experience and a masters at $62,000- plus I plan on coaching (like I do now but I barely get paid anything for it). The cost of living in TX seems lower and I believe I would actually be able to co-buy a home with my boyfriend there. There is no chance we could buy a home here in the next 5 years at minimum. \n\nAny opinions on staying here or moving? Any current TX teachers have an opinion? \n\n\nNote- I\u2019m only 23 &amp; already live states away from my family in NY so moving states again isn\u2019t a crazy thing for me to do.",

This is the week before spring break and the kids are just finishing up old projects.\n\nFriday rolls around and I don't have any pictures, I feel a little guilty but also why did she wait so late in the year to ask for them ? If she is in charge of the yearbook photos why didn't she come in for a few minutes and take them? I didn't think I was even ALLOWED to take pictures of the kids and I was always being pulled in so many directions during class I wouldn't have had time anyway.\n\nAm I right in thinking this should have been the other woman's job or am I just trying to make myself feel better?",

I'm very introverted and have passed that onto my children. The COVID years have not been helpful.\n\nMy son's 3rd grade teacher is on the next level. We've been pursuing a 504 which went through recently.  Before we told her anything, she contacted us with observations and a list of things she had already implemented for him.  She automatically implemented a combination of tough love, allowance for extra time and excusing him from quizzes and assignments he's missed while sick. \n\nI blame her for a significant amount of the personal growth I've seen in my son, both socially and academically. He's gone from a very timid child who was underperforming to a kid who's classmates talk and play with him, who interacts in class and is well above grade average in all subjects. \n\n\nQuestion:  What is the best way I can recognize this teacher? There's the obvious thank you cards and such, but I really want to pursue something that has a tangible impact to her career.",

So there\u2019s no consequences when they continue to talk after I have asked them to stop. \n\nI have tried the self-interrupt technique, and I did it consistently from the beginning of this year. When I stop talking, they eventually get quiet after 30 seconds. However, when I resume, they instantly start talking again. \n\nI did try assigning handwritten discipline reflection papers to those who continued to talk after a verbal warning. I was pretty consistent with this for a while but it never changed the behavior. \n\nGrading their notes seems to work somewhat well, because if they\u2019re writing they can\u2019t be talking, but I had to switch to guided notes for accommodations and have found that they talk through those since they don\u2019t need to write continuously.\n\nI give them random quizzes for correctness at the end of the period and they don\u2019t care. \n\nI only lecture for about 20 minutes at the most. \n\nHow do I fix this?

It is neither my responsibility nor my place to usurp the parent\u2019s right to discipline his or her own child as he/she sees fit.

While I\u2019m sure it worked in the 70s, in the present day any attempt to discipline students seems to turn into a \u201cgame\u201d for them. \n\nConsequently, I just give one verbal warning and if the behavior continues I tell the kid to leave class.

However, the original salary I thought I would receive turned out to be incorrect, as that salary scale was old, and so with the updated info, I'd be making about 4k less than I thought, so I turned it down.\n\nBut apparently this school really wanted me, so they offered me an additional math TOSA position that brought with it a stipend worth about 7k.  I accepted.\n\nFast forward to this week, and I'll be honest, I haven't done much for that TOSA position, mainly because I have no idea what I was supposed to do in the first place.  I was never given a list of duties/responsibilities, or even just a simple written document outlining my tasks, even though I asked for something like that multiple times.\n\nSo it was no surprise that my principal informed me this week that I would no longer be receiving this stipend, starting next school year.  I feel kind of misled about all this because I feel like I could have done a good job if I actually knew what I was supposed to be doing.  I feel like I was put into a position to fail, and I did.\n\nAnyway, this rural school already pays less than basically every other district around here (even with the stipend), so I guess in a way this is good news - I can finally get down to business with my job search.  \n\nMost districts around here pay at least 15k more than what my salary will be next year, so wish me luck on a job offer in the coming months!

Always ignored. \n- Conversation after class. I am not taken seriously. The kid laughs and does not make any effort to engage in the conversation. Before I am done speaking to him, the kid says, \u201cOK, I gotta go\u201d and leaves. Not a deterrent. \n- My own detentions. Not a deterrent. Kids talk through the detention, refuse to abide by my rules, ignore me, don\u2019t show up, or just walk out early. I also don\u2019t really believe in \u201cpunishing\u201d kids by making them sit in a room; I feel it is condescending.\n- Administrative write ups. Not an option for low level behaviors I am dealing with like talking, disrespectful comments, noises, interrupting me, and general disruptions as I have been strongly cautioned by multiple administrators not to use write ups for this reason. I also have no interest in creating a conflict with a parent; sometimes when I write kids up the parents complain to admin or attack me personally. \n- Reflection papers. Not a deterrent. I require them to be handwritten. I have had kids write me over 10,000 words of reflection papers so far this year with no improvement in their behavior. \n- Self-interrupt. Not effective. The kids will quiet down when I self interrupt, but 30 seconds later they immediately start talking again. \n- Calling parents. Incredibly awkward and not worth the stress. Parents have an entitled attitude. Don\u2019t know if it would work because I haven\u2019t tried.\n- Building relationships. I try to do this, but it doesn\u2019t actually have any effect on behavior. \n- Kicking disruptive kids out of class/telling them to take a walk for 15 min. Not effective. They come back after 3 minutes and make a theatrical production out of re entering the room. Or, they go disrupt other classes. \n\nAs you can see, a lot of what I tried simply isn\u2019t effective at all. But I also really have no interest in \u201cdisciplining\u201d kids. I don\u2019t see myself as a moral authority. In fact I just want to fucking teach which I thought I\u2019d be able to do at the high school level. I think most teachers who try to \u201cdiscipline\u201d kids are on a power trip and the kids feel that way too. Anyways, kids do not perceive me as an authority at all; I\u2019m only 7-8 years older than some of them. \n\nSo, how do YOU personally deal with behaviors?\n\nIf I\u2019m not interested in power tripping on teenagers, is this the wrong career for me?",

I am currently very happy in my current position and have no plans to leave. However, I always look out of curiosity at open positions simply to see what\u2019s available. I\u2019ve noticed through the years that one district doesn\u2019t list applications based on individual positions. Instead, they list them by grade level. For example, instead of listing each individual position as they open up, they add a \u201cpool\u201d for each grade level. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking is because, years ago when I was applying for jobs, this was a huge no for me. Personally, rather being called to go for an interview anywhere, I always liked applying for individual positions after researching the school, its mission, programs, etc. This is especially true for this district which has many different types of schools (neighborhood, magnet, Title 1, suburban, urban, IB international, etc.). I\u2019m sure there are many others like me who also like to try and apply for schools only after researching them and I\u2019d think having application pools would limit the applications.",

I have had to teach myself how to live in a world that wasn't built for me and love working with students with autism to help them learn how to thrive too.\n\nTo not dox myself, I'm going to keep things vague. We have a student with autism who has decided to take an elective. Think something like yearbook, choir, etc. where students have to collaborate in order to make a finished product. Since Day 1, the student has **refused** to work and instead plays on his 1 to 1 device, wanders the hallway if he's allowed to go to the bathroom, talks loudly to his friend in the class, never stays in his seat, etc. The elective teacher has tried everything and works within the student's IEP/504. He's gotten so many write ups and detentions it's not even funny.\n\nThe student is now claiming that the teacher is discriminating against him for his autism and how can he expect him to focus on the project??? When the teacher told me this, my skin just about flipped inside out. I was furious. We have so many students further on the spectrum than this one who struggle daily just to function and he has the GALL to blame his disability on why he won't do shit.\n\nAnd now his parents are complaining to the superintendent and school board that our school is \"discriminating\" against him.

        "title": "principal says I need a \"Behavior support plan\"",
        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\n(Second year teacher/5th grade/title 1)\n\n  Yesterday I had a scheduled meeting with my principal to discuss my most recent observation. We didn't discuss any of my lesson that she saw because it had been \"too long\" since the observation and that we would just be having a check-in. The lesson,I thought, went really well and every student was engaged in productive discussion with their groups. \n\n  However, the check-in became a discussion about my behavior management. First, she mentioned that the students need clear procedures for everything. She wants them to listen the first time and have everything run smoothly without students calling out, leaving their seat, or being out of line in the hallway. Generally the kids will try to bunch up in the hallways but I can straighten the line out. Sometimes they call out even after taking behavior points away/giving reminders/praising those who raise their hands. Some kids also will get up without permission to go sharpen a pencil or wash their hands which I don't have a problem with until they go to another table and talk to them. They're supposed to show a hand signal and then I approve it but I haven't been holding then accountable for that. We have a pretty relaxed classroom as I'm a relaxed teacher. We are still learning and having fun. At the same time I have a few crazy kids that ruin it for others and even change the whole dynamic of the classroom when theyre here. They stress everyone out and influence others to be disrespectful/noisy. They are well known across the school and elective teachers/substitutes know my class can be challenging. They've hit each other when I wasn't looking and I got into trouble for not seeing it happen. I have 25 kids in my class so it can be hard to keep up with them all. \n\n    I asked what does she want to see when she comes into the room. She said \"I want you to be the authority figure. Right now the kids are running your classroom\". I disagree in the fact that most of the time they listen and do what they're supposed to, except for those few trouble makers. \n\n  What worries me is I feel I might be targeted. She has been sitting in the room next to me listening for behavior and she would barge in yelling at my students for calling out or arguing with me. She spent two days sitting in that room working on her laptop and listening and coming in to yell. She also proctored one of my tests (which did not require a proctor) and became upset when my kids had trouble logging into the website (which we had only used once before) and that we didn't have enough laptops for every student (which I've already mentioned to the library but they won't give me any more). \n\n  She basically said I have the next two months to get the kids more structured otherwise I will be put on a behavior support plan next year. Then she said.....\"however if you transfer you will not be put on the plan and you will have a fresh start at that school. If you don't show improvement on the plan you will be dismissed\" She also said that maybe I would do better with different types of kids. I feel like she just wants me to transfer and the behavior plan is just a threat to push me out. \n\n  I've tried to get in contact with my union but I think they're off for spring break. I just want to know what you all think of this and what advice you may have? I think my plan is to just try and meet this expectation because I do like the school despite the crazy kids. But I also don't want to get fired...",

Instead of bringing the kids right up to class I gave every kid a paper towel and said clean it up.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes they cleaned their mess and I brought them up to the class. I was going to continue with my science project/lesson but I decided to instead explain to them that even if only a handful of kids are being disruptive, it negatively affects the entire class.

Collected them at the end and ran down to the school aides and told them \"The kids all felt so sorry that they were all compelled to write an apology\".\n\nI don't know how wide a spectrum corporal punishment is considered, I didn't physically reprimand but I did make them write the apology.

        "body": "So, some of you may remember a long post I made about my situation.\n\nI'm a single-income 28 year old divorced woman who will have to be reliant on only myself once my parents sell their house this summer. I conveyed this living situation very openly when I was hired in July of 2022. My parents have planned to retire for a long time, and they deserve to, but I told the school I really needed to be able to survive on my income when that transition happens.\n\nUnfortunately my para-pro salary is only 22k, and my after-school director job (which is an entire beast of a 2nd job with twice as much work) only adds another 7k or 8k onto that. It's.... disgustingly inadequate. I've budgeted and done math seven ways to Sunday, and with only $2,500/month after taxes for 60+ hours per week of work.... this is just untenable. I know \"getting a roommate\" is the easy option, but I've survived some terrible cohabitation experiences, and I cannot rely on having to cohabitate with others in cramped living conditions to survive. As someone working 60+ hours a week, I do feel I am entitled to a level of pay that allows me to rent a 1-person dwelling on my own. Not a luxury dwelling, just, a dwelling. Rent here for a studio apartments in low-income neighborhoods that still  start at $1,000/month. With my income, I don't even *qualify* to apply for a lease, (even if I \"stop buying avocados\").\n\nI won't be able to sustain myself on this pay, and despite me clearly conveying my needs to the school since day one, they have declined to meet them all school year long. The principal keeps having these conversations with me that suggest positive change would be coming, it hasn't.\n\nI had asked them at the beginning of the year when they wanted me to make an intensive STEM-focused after-school program if they were willing to budget for that, because the room was literally bare-ass empty and there was NO equipment whatsoever.\n\nVerbally they said yes, in their actions, they are completely opposite. I've spent almost 2k of my own money supporting THEIR program. I didn't even have shelving in my room until winter break. On top of that, they recently declined to pay for a soil-layer pudding activity that I budgeted to make the cost less than $1 per child for 25 children... a parent had to volunteer to fund the activity so that I didn't have to cancel it. (Which to me, is unacceptable when the parents are paying $60-$65/week for their kid to be there).\n\nI was promised my own smart-touch TV that all other teachers have. I watched them give the TV they ordered for me to another teacher who let their students fuck with their TV and break it. So, that didn't happen. They didn't order a new one for me again either :)\n\nSo, basically, gross lack of funding, rampant mismanagement, and untenable/un-survivable pay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in January, I had responded \"yes\" to the intent to return e-mails, but I now need to know the best way to approach telling the principal that **since my needs are not being met, I can no longer continue with that intent.** It's not that I WANT to just up and leave, I like the dual-language program of the school, and despite the head-assery of front office administration, I would stay if I actually made enough fucking money to literally not live in my fucking car and live off ramen and prayers.\n\nMy plans now are that I am taking a content-area cert exam for my state to get a provisional license (I have a bachelor's degree and I'm going to start an educator program at Western Governor's University online starting June 1st), and after I take that exam and get my score, I 'm going to be applying to middle schools for a middle-grades science teacher position to get a provisional license and become more of a full-teacher vs. the paraprofessional I am right now. It would also be nice to not work 60-70 hours per week and wake up with chest pains and mental-breakdowns from literally just not having a life anymore from working TWO jobs at the school instead of just one like a normal person.\n\nI love my kids, and I've loved teaching, and it honestly makes me want to cry knowing I'll be leaving them and the love they have clearly shown me. They've grown and learned so much and I'm so proud. I can only hope that this is the right choice since these are my feelings. My burnout is coming more from dealing with the adults and administration than the actual job duties and work of my position. The staff at the school have made logistics and operations a fucking nightmare for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a meeting with the principal in less than two weeks to do a performance review. Would this be a good time to let her know my plans and my change in intent and hope she'll be a reference, or, should I list my co-worker teachers as references instead and wait until I've secured a position at a new school before telling her to avoid awkwardness? I've heard the argument for both sides, but, based on my position and situation, I'm not sure which would be better.\n\nI would theoretically *like* to give them a chance to up my pay so that I can stay. I literally took a failing program they had last year with like 11 or 12 kids run by an outside contractor and made it a full enrollment program of 25 kids with a *wait list* for their after school. I'm bringing them revenue, but unfortunately, despite my own investment in THEIR program, and showing them what *growth* actually looks like, they do not want to invest in it, or me. They are a charter school, and seeing what I've seen, and hearing what I've heard from other teachers, I have extreme doubts that my pleas for higher pay will result in anything other than a slap on the hand and a \"nope.\"\n\nPlease give me advice on the best way to proceed Reddit teachers. &lt;3",

        "body": "Hi, I'm a parent, and I'm about at my breaking point with my daughter's school system. She is in 7th grade. Over the years, I have tried my best to support her school and teachers. I always try to buy extra supplies for her teachers. I stand in line for 1-2 hours to vote yes on every school levy. I try to support all the fundraisers, and it seems like there is a new one every month or so.  \n\nIn mid Oct, , I found out that my daughter doesn't use the restroom all day. They're supposed to go in between classes, but they only have like 3 minutes in between classes and her locker isn't close to her classes. She has 27 minutes at lunch, but about 10 of that is used in the lunch line. She told me she doesn't drink anything at lunch so she can avoid peeing. Asking to go during class is frowned upon and some teachers deny it every time someone asks.\n\nHave any of you found a solution to this problem, because what this school is doing is not working, and I'm so over it. People have to pee---that's how bladders work. Holding it all day every day is not healthy. I find it hard to believe that there isn't a way to work it into the schedule somehow, but this school district hasn't seemed go figure it out. At this point, she would have more rights to a restroom in a juvenile detention center than she does in her school. Any suggestions?",

There are a few run-on sentences.",
        "body": "Dear mom,\n\nI walk into the school building every day knowing this might be the day I take a bullet for your kid. I willingly take less money at this job than I could earn teaching elsewhere, or doing something more lucrative with my multiple higher degrees, strictly for the privilege of teaching your daughter. I have personally given your child snacks out of my own lunchbox and tampons out of my own purse. I have worked with her, conferenced with her, encouraged her, and coached her. I have met with her and the school counselor to make sure she wasn\u2019t feeling singled out by the school\u2019s bathroom policy, even when she would be out of the classroom for over 20 minutes at a time on a regular basis, while other kids danced around trying to hold in their pee. I work here 40 hours a week, and then I leave this building every afternoon, weekend, and holiday, thinking about how I could do better, teach harder, accommodate more, for your kid.\n\nStudent teachers come here every year to develop these skills and adjust to this reality. Many of them are optimistic and naive, and not used to the abuse and disrespect that most of us face every day. They are learning how to design curriculum units, plan engaging lessons, grade papers, analyze data, and perpetually be held responsible for society\u2019s ills, while also dealing with the fact that your kid gets to talk to them any way they like while facing no repercussions or taking any responsibility for their actions. My student teacher does all this while not making any money and simultaneously attending grad school at night. Sometimes, student teachers make mistakes and respond to shitty teenage behavior like people, instead of the emotionless information-doling robots you expect them to be.  I\u2019ll be sure to remind the student teacher that expressing any kind of desire to be treated as a human being with dignity is frowned upon in this day and age.\n\nDear mom, even if none of the above were true, it would still be true that when my student teacher told your daughter she would help her\u00a0*after*\u00a0helping another student, I personally sat with your child for the last 30 minutes of class, reteaching her what she missed while she was asleep during the lecture and even going so far as to give her a reduced assignment(!) so she wouldn\u2019t feel overwhelmed with work. That\u2019s 30 minutes more individualized instruction than most of my students received today. I can\u2019t wait to get emails from their mothers.\n\nI\u2019d like you to take a moment here to remember, mom, that in three years of teaching two of your children, I have never been anything but responsive to your children\u2019s needs and promptly respectful of your communication. I don\u2019t know what you do for a living, ma\u2019am, but I\u2019d like you to imagine for just a moment that I showed up at your place of employment, while you were minding your business and doing your best at your job, passed judgement, and then contacted your boss and tried to get you fired. For the record, we don\u2019t lash out at kids because of their parents\u2019 immature bullshit, because we are professionals in an institution dedicated to educating the next generation of people to hopefully know better than to act like you. But if you\u2019d like, have your attorney contact mine. I\u2019m sure they can work something out.\n\nBest,\n\nThe Teacher\n\nP.S. Your daughter is failing the quarter because she didn\u2019t turn in the last project. I suppose we should fire the student teacher for that, also?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\\*DISCLAIMER- Obviously I didn't send this; this is a creative writing exercise mostly for the sake of my mental health. Pandemic learning loss, algebra is hard, parents doing their best to advocate for their kids amid a failing system, blah blah blah. I don't hold any of this against this kid, who is actually pretty awesome. She's allowed to vent to her mother about frustrations at school; that's healthy. It is parents' job to filter this information and recognize when their kid is blaming other people for their problems, and teach them to regulate that, develop awareness of the needs of other students in the room, understand the teacher's perspective, not constantly demand instant gratification, and take responsibility for themselves, instead of immediately dumping on us. \n\nTeachers are people, not punching bags.",

But there's always something with the principal changing things and not notifying me of stuff. She just expects me to know. I have the highest circulation rate in the district out of all the librarians, I hosted the biggest fair at my school ever and in the district this year. I feel like I'm thriving, but sometimes it makes me so upset because she simply doesn't let me do my job by cancelling library. Can any librarians give any advice? I don't want to leave because I'm hoping she'll retire within the next few years. I also love being a librarian. I just need some advice because I've asked for support and the answer is basically just thrown under the carpet and ignored. Luckily, I have signed up for the union now. She has gotten rid of other librarians because they were also annoyed that she wouldn't let them do their job and they were basically substitute teachers for her instead of librarians.",

        "body": "There's a post on a homeschool sub from a parent whose kid is getting expelled for lying about a teacher getting physical with him, and the parent claims the school said the risk to the teacher is too great if the student stays. \n\nI was truly shocked that a school would side with a teacher over the little liar! I have 2 in my class this year who say \"I'm going to tell my mom you hit me\" pretty regularly. I've taken to leaving my door open all the time and when they make the threats, I stop to ask the kids around them what they saw (both to show the liars that other people saw that I didn't and to cement it in the other kids' minds if anything comes up). Fortunately, I am in a good union state, but the school itself would absolutely bow to the kids and parents over a teacher if it came down to it, and I'm just wondering what you all think would happen at your school? Have you ever heard of a student getting punished or even expelled for lying about a teacher?",

I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nExcept for...admin.\nA few months ago there was a miscommunication which resulted in a write up after what looked like a trial - me sitting at a table across from 5 admins and higher ups who basically accused me of being unprofessional and uncooperative. I won't go into details, but all the teachers and coaches on my team backed me up as it was a stupid misunderstanding due to the fact that 1 admin is terrible at communicating and didn't lay out explicit expectations and 2 the fact that I suck at reading between the lines (I'm autistic btw).\n\nIt's been months and I still can't get over it. It crushed me because I know it's \"just a job\" but I work so hard and really care about the school, the kids, and the teachers. The admin that wrote me up is always on some kind of power trip, takes everything personally, treat staff like we're children, etc. I just felt humiliated and I still tear up whenever I think about it. I have never been reprimanded at a job ever, it's just not who I am. I don't want one bad experience to affect everything but I don't know how to get past it.",

This semester feels harder than ever\u2014 student needs are off the charts, disruptive behavior and immaturity is worse than ever, and academic levels are lower than ever. I feel like I\u2019m trying to teach 6th graders (who happen to have driver\u2019s licenses and jobs). For the first time ever, I\u2019ve been considering a career change, which is deeply heartbreaking to me. \n\nSo, with all that being said, I lost my patience more than usual with a boy who got on my last nerve this week. He was just doing pretty common obnoxious/disrespectful stuff like cursing across the room at his friend and playing on his phone with the volume on and whining a lot about redirects. Not great, but I\u2019ve seen it plenty. One on one I said \u201chey we\u2019ve talked about this. you cannot be disrupting your peers like this. put your phone up and give this assignment a try.\u201d He loudly protested with \u201cughh get out of my face! no one else is doing their work and im not the only one talking.\u201d This is an attitude I am officially sick off hearing from 17 year olds!\n\nSo, I responded uncharacteristically harshly with, \u201cthat\u2019s a really childish response and this isn\u2019t 5th grade. and there are lots of people doing their work but you aren\u2019t very observant or good at paying attention to details.\u201d\n\nFeeling guilty and ashamed. Have y\u2019all ever gone a little too far? How do you respond to that juvenile \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one!\u201d type of whining?",

        "body": "Hello everyone yesterday this post was going to be a rant and I was going to have to rant about my week but then today happened. \n\nFirst the down. As most this year has been the worst year for me. I have ups and downs in the year but this year I can count on my two hands the number of good days. From new policy from admin new paper work no one looks at and so on. I was convinced yesterday was my breaking point. I woke up to a flat tire. Well that sucks but I have an air compressor. Good, I will get to work get it handled later. I have to go and do a peep walk for students (scanning, I hate it I get why but I hate it still). Going to work some one was having a worse day than me drove across a median and into a 5 foot deep ditch. This made me even later as the tow truck were blocking the road. Ugh. Then get to first hour find out something bad happened to a student of mine that I should have been made aware, but oh well find out on your own right.  Students are getting crazy as spring break is on its way the usual trying to get out of class but off the scale levels. Had one class everyone was late had no students for about 5 minutes. Break comes around I will call road side have them look and replace tire. We go into some sort of lock down; a lock down but not a lockdown don\u2019t ask I do not know. I ask an admin if it is going to escalate as I have my own personal drama. They don\u2019t think so so I go outside. Roadside is unable to help dang. Have more events that make you want to pull  your hair out. Then I have two students that are always ditching. They have found a few teachers that enable by giving passes or harboring. Well one comes down with pass please excuse. Then about five minutes later I get an email from same teacher keeping this student so they can finish work. Upset that my fellow faculty allows this and decides for me who I should let out of class. ( Here is the deal I am an electives teacher CTE welding 9 out of 10 times I let students go to core classes but out of respect you should ask not Dj USG decide for me. In CTE we have certain thing that we have to do legally with the class he one in 10 events). So now I am mad that this peer of mine does not respect my class or me. Get off work go to tire shop can\u2019t fix till tomorrow. I can\u2019t take off as our agreement states no time off before or after a break. So this was going to be the rant. \n\nThen today 3 of my first hour students pull me to the side. \u201cHey mister we got you a gift.\u201d They show me a little welding helmet key chain from PUBG. I thanked them and told them that this year as been extra hard but them getting in the shop and allowing me to teach make my day bearable. (As we all know apathy this year is horrible many hours I am luck to get 5 students engaged)\nThen my fourth hour come by and one of my students and I talk about the advantages of different amp hours batteries with high demand power tools. He has a welder at home and I have been helping to get him a new bottle of gas. H then tells me he is making a c notch over break. I tell him how to bevel the edges to increase penetration and explain fish plates to him. Finally another student say \u201chey mister my brother was in your class in 18 and wants to catch up he is welding.  Those 5 students gave me the best day. I have had in years as a teacher. I got to teach and learn that some of  my kids use what I teach. I love teaching my trade I talk about the sciences and history of it but the past few years. I have became more of a babysitter. This reminded  me why I became a teacher.",

Yeah, apparently I\u2019ll have to pay money to my district if I have to resign because I can\u2019t pay for gas, and I\u2019d also have to pay money if I was fired because I missed so many days because I can\u2019t pay for gas.",

        "body": "Hello all! I'm (26F) a fully certified high school teacher in Canada. My teachable include English and History. I am also qualified to work within the following classrooms: ESL and Special Education. Finally, I have attained my ABQ for FNMI studies as well as an AQ for guidance counseling.\n\nRecently, I was looking into moving to Florida to be with someone I cared about a whole bunch. This brought up an important question: would it be realistic to move to the USA - would I be able to maintain a career there? \n\nI have just started my journey as a teacher and currently do not have any roots in the district within which I work. Im just doing my first LTO. I don't know if it's worth the risk to move to a whole new country. I would love some insights. \n\nTLDR: Canadian teacher trying to weigh the pros and cons of moving to the USA.",

I\u2019m just faced with a choice and I\u2019m not sure what to do! \n\nI\u2019ve been planning on getting my master\u2019s in the next couple of years. I teach art, and I\u2019ve always planned on getting my M.A. Ed in art ed. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to a program that sounds really cool and just what I want. It\u2019s $15,000. Taking on that debt isn\u2019t ideal but it would be doable. \n\nWell recently, my district applied for a grant for 30 teachers to get their master\u2019s at no cost. It\u2019s in educational leadership, with a concentration in building leadership, aka principal. It\u2019s an accelerated program and is a year long. \n\nI love my job now as a teacher. I have never wanted to be a principal, but I don\u2019t see myself as a teacher forever and would like to take on some kind of leadership position in the future. It would be cool to be the Director of Fine Arts for my district or something. \n\nI applied on a whim because I figure I could use the educational leadership master\u2019s for a variety of leadership jobs in the future. It\u2019s a free degree, why not. 400 teachers applied so I wasn\u2019t feeling hopeful. Well, much to my surprise, I got in. \n\nBut now I\u2019m conflicted\u2026.when I think about getting the art degree, I feel excited. It is what I\u2019m passionate about. I want to be involved in art ed for my career. But it\u2019s $15,000 and 2 years. \n\nThe educational leadership degree isn\u2019t want in passionate about, but it\u2019s absolutely free. And shorter. I think it would help me qualify for a leadership position in the arts, and I don\u2019t want to be a principal ever, but the idea of a free master\u2019s is what pulls me in. \n\nSo\u2026 what would you do? Take on the $15,000 debt for a degree you\u2019re passionate about or take the free degree for something you\u2019re not into at all?",

At the start of the year I feel like my students loved me more than they do now, they were sweeter, drew pictures for me, were excited to be in my classroom, etc. Now they're scared of me or resentful because I hold them accountable to VERY LOW expectations. \n\nI don't want to be weird and I hope none of you make it weird, but I became a teacher because I genuinely love working with children and brightening their worlds. Between behavior management and academic expectations, I have to be a hardass all the time. I can't break structure or play games at all, or my classes loses their shit and flies off the rails. I want to be able to do impromptu jokes, give students room to improvise and shine, acknowledge students creativity and individuality. But all I'm able to do is give consequences and threats. All day, every day. It's like that's my job. Consequences and threats. It's just not the kind of teacher I want to be, but it's the kind of teacher I have to be with my class. I used to do high five handshake or hug with students to connect in the morning (district initiative) and I've even stopped doing that because I can't stop getting god damn sick. Idk. \n\nIdk",

Mrs. Peterson is not here and I have no more paras to support.  Mrs. Mays and Mrs. Tanner will be in and out for assistance throughout the day.  \n\n  Yet, today will have to be a day that we simply combine rooms and have an \"explorative learning\" day.  See me this morning if you need more clarifications on expectations.\n\nThank you and have a great day,\u201d\n\nDo you deal with paras calling out on Fridays a lot? Do you get no help from administrators? I\u2019m exhausted. It was horrible.",

Not sure when they/their parents decided it was okay to not do HW, but it happens all the time (when I say HW, I mean small stuff that is a continuation of what was done in class, not an entirely separate assignment).\n\n\nMy policy is I don\u2019t accept work more than two weeks late. Two weeks ago, I gave my kids a map to color for world religions. One kid, who is a constant pain in the ass about doing absolutely nothing, but complaining and whining to us about having extra time and wanting to be on the honor roll. This kid emails me a few days ago asking for another copy of the map. I told him to print any world map and use that. Yesterday, I ask him if he has it. He says he\u2019s still working on it, but that I\u2019d get it today (the last possible day to turn it in). Today comes and goes, he doesn\u2019t hand it in. I mark it missing in the grade book. He emails me two hours after school ends with a picture of a map saying that\u2019s his and he wants credit. He says he\u2019ll give it to me on Monday. My response is going to be I don\u2019t accept screenshots and that if I have it before the end of homeroom, I\u2019ll take it. But, not after.\n\n\nThe point of all this is that this kid is one of so many others like him who do nothing until the grades go in. Even then, there\u2019s barely any work. The kids and the parents then turn around and blame us when the grades are poor. I\u2019m honestly ready to just give every kid an A, stop caring, collect my check, and go home.\n\n\nI fucking hate this shit.",

        "body": "(17 years in the business, 15 Band and 2 Science, all middle school - for those who might wonder)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. \"It's such a shame teachers have to buy their own supplies...\"\n\nI'm not.  *I* don't need 100 pencils and spiral notebooks.  I'm not buying \"my\" supplies.  I'm buying *yours*. \n\nThis isn't like a plumber buying their own tools, which will go with them to their next job.  This is like the plumber absorbing, out-of-pocket, the cost of all the pipe and fittings it takes to get your house in order.  And also buying all their own tools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. \"Students don't learn from teachers they don't like.\"\n\nI. Hate. This. Garbage. Gaslighting. Quote.  It shouldn't be our *goal* to be unlikeable, but it's going to happen (especially in middle school).\n\n\\- Students absolutely *can* learn from a teacher they don't \"like,\" especially if we don't enslave ourselves to the common, superficial definition of \"like.\" The teachers that, looking back, had the most impact on me were the ones who made me do stuff I *despised* in the moment.  \n\nWe all talked crap about them - being too stupid or lazy to tell us the answers, making us look it up ourselves, making us do outlines and pre-writing, or \\[BARF\\] rewriting... and only later did we look back and see, \"Oh... now we can do these things for ourselves, and many of our peers can't...\"\n\n\\- Students need to learn **how to learn from a wide variety of people**, not all of whom will conform to their preferences.  They need to be able to learn from reading, or writing, or lecture, or lab, or \"exciting\" people, or \"bland\" people.  They need to learn from people who won't let them do whatever they want when they want.\n\n\\- You can't \"get\" a kid to like you any more than you can \"get\" a romantic interest to love you.  They have autonomy, their own range of (wildly fluctuating) emotions, and an intensely immature barometer for \"nice/mean\" or \"fun/boring\" or \"good/bad\" or \"useful/useless.\" \n\n\\- Even if they *do* end up liking me, *I don't go with them to the next level.*  So all I've done is further the ridiculous expectations and make the next level's job harder, as the student will expect even more pandering.  Because we're not doing anything to alleviate the \"need\" for constant enjoyment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.  \"If they're not paying attention, you're not engaging them.\" or \"If they're bored, you're boring.\"\n\nI can't compete with entertainment.  No matter how much cheese you put on the broccoli, it still won't beat cheese-with-no-broccoli-in-it.  \n\nYou can try to \"get\" a kid to eat broccoli by coating it in *candy*, and guess what?  You've destroyed the entire point of eating the broccoli. You didn't \"trick the kid into eating broccoli.\"  *They tricked you into giving them candy for dinner and patting yourself on the back for it.*\n\nLots of people tell stories of how, \"My English teacher dressed up as Mark Twain (or whomever) when they taught us about Mark Twain, and it was so refreshing and different and I'll just never forget--\" What?  Forget what?  That **teacher**.  Because I've yet to meet a single one of those people who remembers Thing One about MARK TWAIN (or whomever).  \n\nSome things are boring (to us, individually).  Some things are boring, period.  And yet, very often, we still have to be good at them.  That's not unreasonable.  It's just life.  No one leaps out of bed, thrilled to clean their bathroom, do the laundry, and pay their bills on time.  But we need to do it, and do it well, and do it without being \"offered a treat\" or \"waiting for it to feel fun.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.  \"Our job is to get them to love \\[subject\\]\"\n\nIt isn't.  For the same reason stated above:  different people are *different, autonomous people*.  You can't get everyone to love everything.\n\nNot everyone who is \"good at math\" loves math.  But everyone who is *bad* at math *hates it*.  Our job is to *get them to do the work well*, so that they at least have the **option** of loving it.  Our job is to get them to understand the **value** of it beyond surface-level enjoyment.\n\nWhen I was teaching band, a phrase I used a lot:  \"You know what's fun?  Being good at stuff.  You know what's often *not* fun?  ***Getting*** good at stuff.\"  Being honest about this moved the ball down the field for a lot more of those students, because - even if they didn't stay in band forever - they at least had experience with the idea that you can be good at things that aren't your very favorite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.  \"Students actually crave discipline/relationship/structure/etc.\"\n\nNo the hell they don't.  Do they need these things?  For sure.  They are not \"craving\" them.  They crave relationships with their peers (so, if you are filling that craving, it's because the are treating you like a peer, and that backfires horribly the first time you say, \"No.\")  They crave passive entertainment.  \n\nThey will push back against discipline and structure.  They will grab, kick, and lick the electric fence... until they (some of them) finally turn around and see there's *an entire field* behind them they could run around it, instead of obsessing about the one patch of grass they're not allowed into.  \n\nIs it easier to teach a student who happens to like you, or your style, or your content?  Of course!  Can we do things to soften the corners for those on the borderline?  Obviously!  But it's also easier to teach kids who understand that learning is what school exists for, so things just go more smoothly if you get on board with doing the job... but no one's trying to push *that* on them, strangely...\n\nWe need to provide stability, predictability, and structure.  They will not \"love us for it\" - certainly not at the time.  They will appreciate, much later, the skills and strategies it helped them uncover... though, in all honesty, they'll probably give themselves credit and remark how \"school barely did anything, and they just taught themselves.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/rant, with my apologies for the length",

        "body": "The other morning, I noticed one of my 2nd grade students had not arrived to my classroom yet. I called his sisters teacher and she said the sister was there and her brother got on the bus with her, so he should\u2019ve been in my classroom. I started to panic as this is a new student who has issues with elopement and a rough home life. Long story short, one of our IAs had found him asleep in the hallway. She brought him back to me, but instead of coming into my classroom, he went and sat at a table outside my room and put his head down. I asked him to come into the room so he could get unpacked, but he didn\u2019t respond. Before I had the chance to ask again, the IA went over to him and dragged the chair he was sitting in down the hall to the front of my classroom door. She then proceeded to pick up my student out of the chair. She didn\u2019t even give him the chance to stand on his own. I was really uncomfortable with what happened, as she does not know this student at all. I have worked hard to build a relationship with him given his past issues with elopement and defiance. He has not tried to elope or been defiant towards me at all in the few months that he\u2019s been with me. He is the sweetest kid who just needs a lot of extra love. I ended up telling my admin and now people are saying she is going to get fired because of me. Did I do the right thing by telling my administration? Did I overstep?",

        "body": "As a student, I find that in classrooms, there are so many students resting their chins on their palms and staring at the teacher, the screen or the whiteboard. The teacher-student interaction seems very unapproachable as when it comes to the teacher asking questions verbally, very few respond and the rest of the class are apprehensive of speaking in front of the class. I find this very contrasting as outside as classrooms, many people socialise with their hands in their pockets. Is this because of the generation gap or age difference?\n\nFurthermore, when teachers come to students asking for help, the students seem to act awkwardly and ingenuinely. For instance, the teachers, after explaining, asks the student if they understand, and the students responds by the phrase \"kind of\", when I read their expression and know at first glance, they don't. Are the students having to lie because they feel pressured to understand all of the A-level content instantly?\n\nWhen it comes to classwork, I saw that in two of the four subjects I am studying, the person sitting next to me is constantly attempting to peek at my answers without me knowing. Again, I wonder if this plagiarism is due to the pressures of understanding the content instantly. However, I know for sure that this kind of action isn't right, and complimenting others by calling them smart doesn't excuse or justifying them peeking.\n\nIn one of these two subjects, I'm also constantly having to deal the classmate peeking at my answers putting THEIR STUFF on MY DESK. Like seriously, can you not? Sometimes, people are so inconsiderate of their surroundings and they need to realise that other people need desk space too. Imagine what it would be like to share a bed with people like them.\n\nUsually, the learning environment in sixth form colleges is meant to be relaxed, so this would mean that sometimes for this to happen, teachers would try to make a humourous statement and then some of the students would break into some forced laughter. But now, having observed the extreme level of negative body language, awkward silences, pretense, plagiarism and inconsideration, I'm starting to contemplate whether the students are staring and note-making just to pretend to be engaged and interested in the classroom.\n\nIs there any explanation for all of this?",

And then she was sitting in my class immediately after lunch. As far as I could tell, no consequence. A little smirk on her face. I thought, surely the principal is going to do something about this. This was all 2 days ago.  Today, I checked to see what was written up in our digital files for her conduct report.  OUR ADMIN CUT ACCESS TO CONDUCT.  We aleady can only see students that are in our actual classes, which has caused problems.  But now we can't see conduct history or writeups for our own kids. \n\nI found someone who still has unrestricted access (guidance), and looked- the incident is not even entered.  Apparently, the girl cussed out another teacher the same day, and got 1 period of internal suspension as the consequence for that.  Nothing for the hate and threats spewed at this boy, not even a note in the file.\n\nAnd admin is so cowardly, so hell bent on holding no one accountable, that they are now hiding their inaction from us, as best they can.

There is a widespread lack of zeal for work and feeling for duty. Many school pupils believe that they can just sail through their school-leaving examinations by sitting tight for eight years even if they fall way below the required intellectual standard. In the Hiter Youth and Junior Hitler Youth units there is no kind of support for school; on the contrary, it is precisely those pupils who serve in leading positions there who are noticeable for their disobedient behavior and their laziness in school. It is necessary to report that school discipline is noticeably declining and to a worrying degree.\n\n*The Third Reich in Power*, Richard J. Evans",

He struggles with violent behavior and has made shooting threats, so he's failing behaviorally and academically. \n\nI know I need to fail this student to hold him accountable for the lack of work he's completed, but I still feel awful. Failing kids makes me feel nauseous. I know he doesn't care, but I do, and even if he wants to shoot me, I still care about him. I feel like I'm placing the final nail in the coffin because this kid is going to have to repeat fifth grade, and he struggles so much with his sense of self-esteem and identity.\n\nAny advice on how to alleviate this feeling? I feel physically ill.",

There are other students who have said and tell the truth, but they are not being brought in. Instead parents and students who the counselor is choosing to represent are being brought to Assistant Principal/Principal. \n\nEvent: \nThe counselor messaged me asking me to come today or tomorrow to see her during my conference. She did not state for what, but I figured it was for grades as the term is closing and a couple of students are not passing. I go and she brings up with me all these rumors. I deny. This goes on for a couple minutes. I am calm and aware during this time since I expect she is trying to get me to say anything she could/would use against me. As nothing comes from the conversation, she says we can figure it out next week. I say okay. I go to exit (at door) and she \u201casks\u201d as I\u2019m about to open the door what is she suppose to do about the rumors\u2026 I asked what do you mean. I affirm they are not true. She doubles down and says how we are adults, equal, and that she is not and cannot reprimand me. She then says the next step is to share what she \u201chas\u201d with admin. I say okay (have nothing to hide). Then she says let\u2019s take a break and talk about this next week. That I am being hostile towards her\u2026\n\n\n\nWhat do I do? Please help.",

Not here to argue with 14 year olds at 35.\n\nI just had security come pick him up. I kept making mistakes while delivering my lesson, and my brain was in a fog. Luckily, most of my 1st period is very kind and understanding. I apologized for my mistakes and corrected myself.\n\nHe will be the second student I have had to remove from class. My class management isn't perfect, but I somehow managed to reach most of my problem students so that we could learn. It took a half a school year, but we are getting through lessons now.\n\nI called his mother, as we have lot's of contact with each other. I have had so much patience with this kid. So much. He has no electronics or anything. He doesn't care about anything. His mom doesn't know what else to do, I don't know what else to do. Im just.....tired of him. I don't hate him. He has never disrespected me so loudly before, but now it's just like he is checked out. He's rude to everyone. I sometimes just wonder what's going on with him for there to be no care at all for anything or anyone. \n\nI am just going to recommend him to the counselor and hope something changes because I don't like how I feel right now.

(I should add that he has straight As, so he's not struggling with the concepts).\n\nJust wondering, without going into too much detail, what do you want from a parent here? At home we have boundaries, chores, very little screentime, etc. But, he also has a lot of free time. I know my child can be defiant. I can't imagine getting him to do schoolwork all day. \n\nI have already offered to volunteer and offered strategies that work at home. But, honestly, he IS a lot of work. He has always been difficult (even as a newborn), and he's always needed a lot more management than my other kids. I can really feel the teacher's frustration.",

A bit of background : I have been a teacher for almost 15 years now in a wide range of locations and school types around the world. I now find myself at a school in Asia.\n\nSo back to the question at hand. At the start of semester, we were presented with a \"Curriculum\". In other words, a text book. No other content. Only a text book, and told to go out and teach it.... Parents complained, management got upset, so they decided to up the ante and add the CCSS, or, common core standards (US) to the mix. The director then stated \"Our curriculum is the CCSS\". I got into a heated debate with him, with other teachers backing, as to how and why the ccss is not a curriculum. He refuses to agree and rejects any criticism of the \"Selection of CCSS as curriculum\" as he phrased it.\n\nSo, Would any other teachers accept such a \"Curriculum\"?\nAm I completely wrong? Is the ccss a curriculum?\nWhat would you describe as being the bare minimum requirement for being a curriculum?",

        "body": "I feel like this rant belongs here, as maybe some of you may have the same issue.\n\nI'm a young ESL teacher for middle schoolers, still studying in university myself (just for background information).\n\nThe task was not set by me, but I have to advise the students for their presentations, as I am their teacher. To make things efficient, the other teachers decided on deadlines. Today, they had to show me the introduction (goal, tasks) and sources.\n\nPlans were sent, examples included, presentation examples were shown in class multiple times, as well as several messages about reminders of the plan.\n\nWhy is it so hard to move a single braincell and do something? Either they just didn't do anything at all or sent me an introduction like: \"Hello, my name is...\". When I emailed a student back, stating that there was, indeed, a plan to follow, I received a: \"There was a plan?\"\n\nSo in class, I asked them to show me what they have. Silence. Quieter than anything on a cold winter night. Of course, I asked them what the introduction means and the responses consisted of \"I don't know\" in very defeated tones or \"Hello, my name is...\". And the best part is, I had literally put the plan ON THE BOARD in front of them. If they had just moved their eyes a TINY bit, they'd see it.\n\nAnd then, after explaining what an introduction was, questions about sources came. \"I don't understand what we have to do\". After I point them to the board where the rules and examples are, they look absolutely devastated and irritated with me.\n\nSo what happens next? I ask them, politely, to do it in class, ask for help. Chaos. Complaints. And some STILL not understanding where to find the plan, not even after I give even more examples on another board.\n\nWorst case is, they're quite capable, but extremely lazy. Making mistakes is normal and expected, but not moving a single nerve in your finger or not trying to rack your brain a tiny bit is just so exhausting... Thankfully, there are still some kids that try something and it's such a blessing. It just makes me feel bad for trying so hard and receiving so little effort back.",

His work is decent, he has a B in the class, but he has the worst attitude. I've repeatedly told him, regarding the current assignment, to keep experimenting with the design of his work. His sketches are basically the same over and over, and he even said there's \"only one or two ways to draw this\" which is just...not true. \n\nI understand some people aren't super creative, but I've told him to keep trying and to look up examples of what I'm looking for, but he just doesn't. This project is graded on a combination of effort and technical skill with the software. \n\nSo my issue is, the project is due March 21st. It's Spring Break next week so I wanted to give them time to get it to put together since I assigned it a couple of weeks ago. Today, I noticed he turned his work in early. It's not good, creatively or technically. \n\nI've repeatedly explained to him what to do to get a higher grade, everything except for just doing the whole project for him. I've held his hand pretty much all semester, trying to encourage him to just try. My question is, should I reach out to him and tell him it needs more work, or let him see what happens when he doesn't listen? \n\nAn important thing to note is that I do allow resubmissions of assignments for a higher grade at the end of the semester, so it's not like this would tank him. But I think it may be a good learning opportunity. Or am I being mean here, and because I did see it now I should say something? \n\nThanks for any input for a new teacher!",

        "body": "I'm currently a junior in college studying education aiming to be a highschool language or ESL/EFL teacher. Every time I look at this sub, it's a torrent of posts about how awful teaching is for a myriad of reasons. Even in my education classes, there's always a shared understanding among students and professors that teaching is incredibly challenging and that we might all be making the wrong choice. \n\nI decided to pursue education mostly out of a love for the subject matter (languages). As I've taken more classes, a lot of other aspects of teaching have really started to appeal to me like organization, trying to always improve, doing something tangibaly helpful (as opposed to just exploiting laborers in some business setting, for example) helping young people grow, helping to enact social change and create a welcoming space for all students, etc. \n\nI'm not sure I have the grit for it, however. I'm a pretty soft and sensitive person, and hearing horror stories about student behavior or even just generalized apathy scares me. I realize how strange this is for an education major, but I was also homeschooled K-12. I know generally what schools are like, but I've never experienced one from the inside perspective of a student and I'm worried I don't completely know what I'm getting into. \n\nIt may also be worth mentioning that I'm queer and nonbinary, which I fear may cause trouble with parents or school boards if I don't stay 100% closeted.\n\nAlso, teachers are notoriously poorly paid, but browsing this sub and searching online, it seems like pay rates vary dramatically based on situation and country. I don't have any dire financial situation or debt that I need to address, but obviously being decently paid would be nice.\n\nI'm trying to hold open as many doors as possible in case that may increase my chances of getting an actually good job. I'd be willing to teach in basically any country (except ones that would be unsafe for me, obviously) and I'm willing to teach at public, private, or academy type institutions. I have more than one subject matter I could teach and I've been told a degree from my university is very good preparation and hopefully will look good to schools. I also plan on getting a graduate degree if that increases my chances of finding a good placement. \n\nEven with all these options, am I making a mistake? After working myself to the bone in highschool in order to get into college and now doing the same in college, I feel kind of stupid aiming for a job that is horrifically underpaid and that seems to be requiring less and less qualifications each year. My other option right now is to go into academia (which is fraught with its own issues) so it's not like there's no turning back at this point. \n\nIf you think going into education was worth it, what makes it worth it for you? What is rewarding enough that makes you stay?\nAnd if I should continue pursuing education, are there any countries/types of positions that I should aim for to get the best outcome possible?",

But this year it got really cold for Florida (below 50\u00b0 multiple times) so I asked if it was okay for us to wear jeans when it\u2019s lower than the 50s. My answer was that our district has been picky on teachers \u201cnot looking professional\u201d so she said no to the jeans on cold days. Pretty inhumane if you ask me. \n\nBut the worst part about this is that we\u2019ve been having some staff out a lot lately to using their personal days for whatever, as they should, and sick days because people get sick around this time of year. So because of this, my principal said that any day there\u2019s 100% staff attendance that we can wear jeans the next day. That really just sends a bad message in my opinion. Like I care more about getting everyone to come to work than I do about them being warm on cold days. \n\nThis is the type of stuff that makes me feel less valued as a human being as a teacher.",

        "title": "[Australia] Tips for avoiding occupational burnout",
        "body": "*Symptoms*\n\nDealing with the symptoms of burnout can paradoxically involve working harder (to enjoy your job more) rather than working less. The three symptoms of burnout are:\n\nEmotional exhaustion. You can fight this by using more discipline/strictness in the classroom to give your students less opportunity to wear you out. Alternatively you could try a Stoic approach where you don't take their bad behavior personally (\"I can't control my students, I can only control how I react to them\")\n\nDepersonalization (not caring about your students). Fight this by learning your students' names, ages, what they're good and bad at, etc.\n\nReduced performance. When you're burning out you'll often leave lesson planning to the last minute. You will enjoy teaching more if you are more prepared before each class, taking some time to \"rehearse\" what's going to happen (even if it doesn't actually go that way with live students)\n\n*Stressors*\n\nApart from the aforementioned badly behaved students, the main stressors at work come from admin stuff. In Australia (and probably other countries) teaching is seriously overregulated, and every year they just make the job description longer.\n\nSometimes you have to ignore the rules. We know that part of the reason the profession exists is because of the economy of scale (teaching 24 students at once is more efficient than teaching them separately) so why destroy that by personalizing everyone's learning? Time-honored tools like bloom's taxonomy can be used, but don't be ruled by the latest fads that are going to be called pseudoscience by 2025 (like \"visual, auditory and kinesthetic learners\")\n\nDividing workload with other teachers in your department (like writing and marking assignments and exams) can reduce workload and stress, but don't hold too many meetings with other teachers otherwise the administrative overhead of the meetings will outweigh any efficiency gains\n\n*Lifestyle changes*\n\nGet enough sleep. Since school starts in the morning, you can develop a regular routine of going to bed by around 11pm each night even if you're normally a night owl\n\nI hear that exercise can be helpful though I haven't tried it myself\n\nFor the 2-week holidays between each term, I find it best to schedule busy activities (like faraway travel) for the end of the holidays, that way you always have something to look forward to instead of dreading the return to school",

I told them no and that they need to go back to there class, then they began to argue that there teacher actually let them come and get work from me. Mind you both of these students are disruptive and argumentative, so they continued to argue back and forth with me about how they should be let into class to do work and to do their project. Finally after shouting and arguing that they need to do the work in my class they decided to instead take the work with them and go back to class. I agreed and went inside to grab there work, as I did that they came inside and started to play fight and argue with five of my students. Come to find out these five students and these two girls apparently have some kind of love triangle or something going on so the whole reason why they wanted to come in to my class was to flirt and play fight. I kicked them out as soon as I saw they started to push and shove one another as a game. I wrote them up and called home. However after school I went up to ask the teacher who supposedly let them out to do work if this was true and the teacher said yes she always lets her students do that if they finished her work. I then explained how they came to play fight and be disruptive instead of actually get any work done, she then said \u201cOkay well what did you want me to do about it\u201d I was taken back by her response but I told her \u201cWell nothing I guess but please don\u2019t send them back to me for work while I\u2019m teaching.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything so I just left, am I wrong for feeling annoyed/ angry by her response?",

And I hate him also. Using \"I hate him\" as an excuse for him not to own his horrible behaviours has been an ongoing pattern all year. The strategies I've tried are endless. Positive reinforcement, bribery, gentle calm soothing voice, praise, opportunities to get class attention (which they fiend off of), alternative work spaces until they can make better choices in my room.\n\nAll of this to say, if I hated your kid so much, I'd wash my hands of them and let them self sabotage their way to nowhere and not care at all. \n\nGod I want to rant to this mom SO BADLY.

I've been used as an emotional punching bag for kids who are having a rough day. I've had a student start a literal poll in the middle of my lesson where he went around and asked all the students in my class to check a box if they hate me or not. All of the above students took the much needed time to cool off, talk it out with myself or another adult, and eventually they came to me and apologized for their behaviour, and we moved on. \n\nIf I don't hate those individuals, I certainly don't hate this one. There are so many lines of work I could consider, where I'd happily work spring break not to deal with this emotional abuse. Mom, I don't hate your kid. I hate how they get to power struggle with me every single day- unchecked- and then get to use \"me hating them,\" as an excuse to continue the behaviour.",

        "body": "This article is a complete guide about what is the best document camera for teachers? Many other questions are also discussed in it.\n\n \n\n## Why do teachers need document cameras?\n\nWhat actually is a document camera? So for those who are unaware, a document camera is a digital teaching tool that teachers can utilize in the classroom to portray and share information with the class.\n\nYou can simply set textbooks, books, papers, or even three-dimensional objects under the camera and it will be projected onto the screen.  \n\n\nSo this is a great way to have an attractive classroom.  \n\n\nBecause both students and teachers may exchange real-time data, such as worksheets or notes, in the classroom.\n\nTeachers enjoy using this for peer evaluation or an error analysis, exercise with their students, modeling, and action.  \n\n\nSo, in stem classes, science, and math classes, there's generally a lot of modeling with objects, so you can just place your hands under the camera and model an action.  \n\n\nDespite a document camera's usefulness, you should be aware of any drawbacks or shortcomings.  \n\n\nTo begin with, the price of a document camera can range from $90 to nearly $600 depending on the brand and type, and this is because some are more complex than others.  \n\n\nAnother disadvantage is that you usually need a smart board or projector to attach it to, which may be a disadvantage if you're a traveling teacher.  \n\n\nMore expensive products have a projector, however, the price is also a problem in this case.  \n\n\nWhen we compare the two, some of the benefits include sharing live data, it's very student friendly, and it's perfect for modeling and stem classes, as well as activities like peer evaluation and error analysis.  \n\n\nSo my professional recommendation is to invest in a document camera because it's worth it. \n\n[https://www.stuninginfo.com/2023/01/best-document-camera-teachers.html](https://www.stuninginfo.com/2023/01/best-document-camera-teachers.html)",

        "body": "This is my second year teaching third graders. Although they can be as sweet as possible and it has been a great year so far, they have hit a REALLY rough patch the past four weeks. \n\nI have kids straight up refusing to do work, beating each other senseless, and just being destructive. Just today a kid punched another student in the mouth and knocked out two of her teeth! \n\nAdmin has been very sparsely involved. They lecture us heavily about SEL and the dangers of humiliating/ missing out of rewards. \nToday was the first time they pulled a student out of class to talk and he was sent back twenty minutes later. Sadly, this is miles ahead of what they usually do. \n\nAllegedly, they called the parents. But the parents do not care. They are always either very argumentative or too shocked they\u2019re darling would ever act out. \n\nI\u2019ve tried calling parents; assigning homework that\u2019s not completed in class; putting in zeroes to show students consequences; having them miss out on parts of recess to complete work if they were too busy goofing off; and minor public shaming. Unfortunately, the nothing has been sticking. \n\nI need ideas for ways to reign this back in before it gets any worse. Open to almost anything!",

        "body": "So, I\u2019m going to start by being honest about what this post is. I\u2019m looking for advice and I want to ask about whether this situation is normal or whether it\u2019s a me issue. \n\nI\u2019m a first year middle/high school English teacher, graduated college last May, and I\u2019m struggling. The beginning of the year felt pretty okay; the administration was supportive, other staff were nice, students were.. well, they were middle and high schoolers but they were alright. I only had one decently sized issue at this time. My school didn\u2019t give me my curriculum until I asked for it, and even then they didn\u2019t give me the curriculum for speech or for creative writing. Sometime in second quarter they gave me the speech curriculum but now it\u2019s the beginning of fourth and I still don\u2019t have one for creative writing. Am I supposed to have to ask for that? Is that something the school is supposed to just supply me? Am I being entitled in this? At the beginning of the year I didn\u2019t even know exactly what a curriculum entails, let alone how to ask for it. Now I know what it is and how to use it, just.. not sure whether it\u2019s normal to have to ask for it or not.\n\nAside from that, some massive issues have come up. At the beginning of the second semester, my principal\u2019s support just dropped off of the face of the earth and now I feel like I\u2019m drowning. My mentor is useless, which for once I know isn\u2019t my fault, but now it feels that the administration are actively against me. I don\u2019t know what exactly their expectations are of me because they don\u2019t tell me until I fail to meet them in which case they jump to an angry email and a disciplinary meeting. When one of my freshmen plagiarized, the principal responded to my email asking what to do in a way that felt passive aggressive and as if I was to blame and had me talk to him. Administrators talk behind my back as if the freshmen (who have caused issues for every teacher before and during my time) behavior issues are a result of poor classroom management on my end. Other than my para (who is amazing and beautiful and unfortunately treated horribly within the school) I feel so alone. Today, my principal sent me an angry-sounding email telling me that I haven\u2019t been putting grades in enough. I\u2019ve been doing at least once a week like she told me to at the beginning of the year. Suddenly in the email she wants two per week. It just feels so inconsistent and impossible to follow and I\u2019m getting no guidance on it whatsoever. When I try to ask my principal questions, it feels like I\u2019m at fault for something or like she\u2019s short with me. \n\nTo put the feeling into words, it feels like I\u2019m drowning at the bottom of the ocean. The closest thing to a floatie I get is miles above me and every time I try to swim up to it someone tells me I\u2019m swimming wrong and pushes me right back to the bottom of the ocean, this time shoving rocks and sand on me. I feel so defeated. I feel like I can\u2019t do anything right and even if I could I don\u2019t know what the school sees as right. \n\nThis.. isn\u2019t normal for teaching, is it? This isn\u2019t a me thing? What do I do? My para is abused by the school too and she tells me it isn\u2019t my fault but I guess I need some form of validation from someone I\u2019m not personally close to because I can\u2019t do it. I just don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this post feels all over the place and I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s breaking a guideline I\u2019m not fully aware of, I just desperately need some help or encouragement or SOMETHING because my administration isn\u2019t giving that to me.",

        "body": "I teach mod/severe special Ed, and over the years I\u2019ve seen parents become more and more sue-happy. I haven\u2019t been a victim myself, but a teacher I knew stopped taking his medication for a serious condition and intentionally died because of a serious lawsuit. I know for a fact the teacher was completely innocent of what the parent was claiming (abuse) as a close friend was in the classroom when an accident happened and saw the whole thing. The teacher did nothing wrong. The parent said it was intentional and lied and said there was a history of abuse (bruises and such). She sued the hell out of the district and the teacher himself. She lied to reporters and everything, and he was not allowed to defend himself publicly of course because the district\u2019s lawyers told him to not respond. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m finishing a book and plan to either look for a publisher or self-publish and write more. \n\nI realize I may never make a dime. However, I have an unusual and pretty awesome last name. I am easily findable with a google search, and if I have a book out there, a parent may find out. I\u2019m afraid one may find the material objectionable or may think I have money even if I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really want to chance having a parent accuse me of something. Then again, it\u2019s a pretty catchy last name. \n\nThe other idea is to just use my maiden name. It\u2019s not that great though, and my sister-in-law has the same exact first and last name since she married my brother. \n\nWhat would you do? I know I might sound paranoid and the risk is tiny, but since seeing that teacher go through all that I am really concerned about something like that happening.",

I've seen all three of these kids- oldest sister is now in middle school, middle is in fifth grade, youngest is in fourth.\n\nThe middle kid, for as long as I've known him, has been the kid that will discreetly make the lives of the kids around him a living hell but as soon as a teacher finds out he's in denial mode. He especially eggs on a kid in his class that has a hard time regulating his emotions. \n\nWell finally it happened. He picked on the wrong kid in PE and this kid fucking WAILED on him. I'm not saying he deserved it, but he fucking deserved it. He fucked around and found out.\n\nSo of course, after my PE colleague let's them do their thing for a few seconds, she matches them down to the office and has the kid call his mom.\n\nOh by the way, mom is a behavior strategist at another school.\n\nOf course, mom takes the kids side, despite conceding that her kid started it and acknowledged that shouldn't have been bullying the kid. But then she talks about how they treat him when all the teachers are turned around, and how no one in the class will play with him at recess (well yeah, he's being a shithead) and that all of the times she gets a phone call she cries because he's never like this at home. (Big eyeroll there. He's the MIDDLE CHILD of three very close in age and you mean to tell us that he NEVER picks on his little brother?!?)\n\nThe funny thing?

        "title": "Not a teacher, but my mom's school is driving teachers to burn out",
        "body": "So I'd like to start off by saying that I'm not a teacher. My mom has been a teacher for a while for a few different school boards in different languages. The school she is at right now is down right awful. \n\nHer school is located on a rather affluent neighborhood and the students act like it. They are super sheltered and unaware of what is going on in the world. They also like to parrot whatever they hear their parents say, which, unfortunatly, most of the time happens to be vile racist and ableist rhetoric. There is actually a huge racism problem with the students. Recently it's gotten so bad that the students feel comfortable calling black students dirty slaves in the middle of class. Absolutely nothing is done by the administration (not sure if that's the right word in english) because \"they can't prove who threw the note with the racist statements on it\" or \"they are almost teenagers they are just acting out\". \n\nOn the topic of the administration, my God are they so incredibly incompetent. From what my mom has told my the principal is a former teacher and the vice is a remedial teacher (once again idk if that's the right word, orthop\u00e9dagogue in french) so you'd think they would be acutely aware of what it's like to be a teacher. But they routinely downplay students' psychological/learning diagnosis because they don't want to deal with the paper work. They also actively ignore bullying when it's brought up to them once again butcause the students are almost teenagers. The punishments they give are basically slaps on the wrist \"don't do that any pls\" type of things so obviously the students don't take any of the teachers seriously. \n\nFinally, one of the most worst aspect of this whole situation is how the administration treats the teachers. It screams \"I used to be one of you but now im not and I'm better for it\". They go out of their way to antagonise, demean, bully, gaslight and talk behind the backs of all the teachers. For example, my mom this year has an autistic student who had a violent episode before spring break. Thankfully none of the students were in the class when it happened so my mom was able to calm the student down without getting any other students involved but she still asked the administration for some kind of protocol in case it happened again so she could evacuate the classroom. She asked for this before the break and now that we're back it turns out that they won't be doing anything because they don't think the situation is important enough for them to care. My mom asked the teacher in the classroom next door and was told that whenever students in her classroom had episodes she just put her students in the hallway because there was nowhere else for them to go. \n\nThe absolute worst that they done is push a teacher to what seems like an early retirement because of stress and burn out. For the couple of years my mom has been working at this school it always seemed like this one particular teacher always got the worst of the problematic students, like she could never catch a break. The past few years at least once a year she took time off for burn out leave. This year was by far the worst, with a large number of her students being extremely problematic. From what I was told, by the end of every week she would leave the school in tears and told my mom that she was thinking of quiting because of the students. At some point near the end of December/beginning of January she had enough and told the administration that she wasn't able to handle the students by herself anymore and that she needed some kind of help in the classroom to properly deal with all the students. She also mentioned how her mental health was very poor and that her students were making it a lot worse. The administration responded by saying that it was awful she was having such a bad time and if she needed psychological help the school board has mental health services if she needed them. Basically they weren't going to do anything and she was the crazy one. This teacher ended up taking a leave of absence two weeks before March break and we found out she wasn't coming back for the foreseeable future. To add insult to injury, whenever a teacher takes a leave of absence because of burn out (it happens that regularly at this school) the principal sends an email to all the staff saying so-and-so is taking a leave and we sincerely hope they get better and come back healthier than ever. For this teacher, the email basically said she's going to be gone. My family really thinks they wanted her gone. \n\nThis is probably such an incoherent block of text, I'm so angry about this and writing in English is really not my Forte. But I really wanted to tell at least someone about this. My entire family is so conflicted about all of this. It's clear how it is right now is actively harming students and teachers, but at the same time I'm also aware of how underfunded the entire education system is. Even if we said something and people listened, what could actually be done??? \n\nAnyways thanks for reading my frustrated rambles.",

I wrote very simple sub plans: to have students sit on a dot on the floor and quietly watch a movie about Beethoven, because I know many substitutes are not comfortable teaching General Music to young students.\n\nWhen I returned, I found out the substitute did not follow the plans and instead gave Kindergartners \u201cfree time\u201d to roam my classroom and touch the instruments around the room without supervision. I am upset and disappointed and I am unsure what to do regarding the matter.",

Well i\u2019m 30 and I still remember this incident)\n\nIn grade 11 english class, I had this teacher and she was very loud and negative and I felt like she didn\u2019t like me from the very beginning for no reason that I can think of. I\u2019m a very quiet student, studies hard and gets 95+ in every class, until her english class. We were given an assignment to write this paper (12 pages) and when I handed my paper in, I put the sheets in a pretty folder to keep things organized, I definitely could have just stapled it but it was pretty thick.\n\nWhen I handed her the folder she yelled \u201cNO, i don\u2019t do none of this extra credit crap [referring to the folder i guess]. You\u2019re going to hand this in like everybody else. I don\u2019t do that\u201d. She said it so loudly everyone in the room was staring and I embarrassingly apologized and took the sheets out, handed them to her, and went back to my seat.\n\nMind you, I have never even talked to her 1-1 before this. I just like things organized. I didn\u2019t think about getting bonus marks for the way my assignment looks.\n\nWhen i got my assignment back, I got one of the lowest grades in my class (70%). Before this i was consistently pulling 95+ in english.\n\nEver since then my english mark in her class was always below 79. She knew that I wanted to go into a competitive program in college that requires at least 80%.\n\nI guess was I being wronged the whole time?

On a picture, he's pulling the ponytail of a 16 year old girl and stuffs his face in it. On another picture he's got a girl propped on his shoulders.\n\nI talk to a colleague of mine. He's appalled as well. We decide that we need to report this. We ask for a meeting with the principal. Our school is pretty big. Over 2K students. It's private. Pretty posh.\nAfter meeting with us, the principal and vice principal meet with the teacher. He tells them that it has been a tradition for years. He keeps a scrapbook of hair of girls (our school is co-ed) that he taught. It's sick. \nThey tell him to stop. No other consequences\n\nThey meet with us and tell us that the case is closed. That if we ever bring this up again, there will be consequences. \nIt's been 3 years. He's still in charge of organizing trips to Europe. More stories keep popping up.

The big project for this unit is for students to write a paper on a topic of their choosing. We have to approve it (so nothing about Columbine unless it's the flower, nothing about sex, no drugs) and even give lists of possible topic suggestions. \n\nAnd every year? I often witness a transformation within a lot of students. I see students who ordinarily pad their essays to just get the minimum page count suddenly struggle to get it under five pages. I have surprisingly few students who submit plagiarized essays for this. \n\nWe also get to read a surprisingly diverse set of essays. Last year, a student chose to write about how Skateboarding became an olympic sport. Another wrote about how the Church of Latter Day Saints was founded - without even citing South Park as a reference. I read a paper where a twelve year old used \"Saponification\" in a sentence. I even saw one paper that was about the movie *Clue*. Sure, I had to give it a C- because they had a hard time keeping on track, but it was still impressive to see a \"D\" student happily write about a 1980s cult classic movie. \n\nKnow that the passion can always be there. Sometimes students end up finding something that they find interesting. One student had trouble finding a topic, wrote about coffee, and said they actually thought coffee machines were fairly interesting. \n\nAnd the best part is? I don't have to do much to make it \"interesting\". So suck it, administration.",

You interview with all the principals from the district at once and then they pick the interns they want in their order. I had a principal from a school I previously student taught at approach me before interviews and convince me to interview with his district, because he wanted me to teach at his school. He told me to interview badly so no one would pick me before him. I interviewed on Monday mediocre. I didn\u2019t have eye contact with any one other than him, had short answers, etc. Then later that day I got a call from someone at my university that I didn\u2019t get a spot\u2026anywhere, even at other schools. The principal never reached out to me. I\u2019m pretty devastated and seriously doubting my abilities and career choices. I know teachers are supposedly needed everywhere\u2026but how could I have not been selected in this process?

        "body": "I'm a secondary school Social Studies teacher in my fourth year of teaching. I have a decent head of my department, I have benefits, I have a steady paycheck during a time of economic uncertainty, I even teach all AP classes, which are of a \"manageable\" size. As teaching goes, this should be Shangri-La, right? I should be happy, right?\n\nI'm not.\n\nI drafted up my reasons why today while in class, adding to them as the old feelings and problems reared their ugly heads all day. Here's my take:\n\n- The pay I receive is not commensurate with the amount of value I provide.\n\n- The extra time I work outside of contract hours remains as unpaid labor. I have tried my best to balance my time. I can do so no longer.\n\n- When I have asked for basic classroom support, such as separating disruptive students into separate class periods, expressing explicitly that I wanted to retain them and that I was unwilling to give up on them, I have been rejected with quibbling qualifications that undermined my professional credibility and basic dignity.\n\n-The amount of disrespect and apathy I face on a daily basis disturbs me emotionally, both inside and outside of the workplace. \n\n-The passion I have for the content I cover is a fire inside of me that has been quenched repeatedly and thoroughly by the realities of education in America. The realities are that this system is fundamentally broken, and will not improve \u2013 at the very least, not anytime soon.\n\n-I cannot continue to work in an environment that limits my basic human necessities, like bathroom and lunch breaks.\n\n-This \"career\" is exploitative, providing little to no opportunities for advancement and growth, especially pertaining to pay. There is no reward for the ample merit I have demonstrated. \n\n-Public education in America has been deliberately sabotaged by moneyed interests, in order to poach successful students for private and charter schools. The rest are foisted upon already overburdened schools that have little to no teeth in dealing with students that display no regard for participating in their own education. This is not my fault, nor is it my responsibility to remedy. I have done what I can.\n\n-I am not a statistic, nor am I beholden to them. Most teachers quit before 5 years because of the problems on this list and more. I will be quitting at four years of service, not including a year of student-teaching. It is okay to let go and prioritize myself. I have nothing to prove.\n\n-I will not be a victim of the sunk-cost fallacy. I have made progress in this field. I have hundreds of hours of quality instructional resources, ones that have been successful in many different classes and have captured the attention and admiration of many students. It is okay to never use them again. I will make progress elsewhere.\n\n-I want to work somewhere where the printer, WiFi, and air conditioner function properly.\n\n-When I go home at the end of the workday, I want to cast off my professional life until the next morning and dedicate myself to what truly matters \u2013 my loved ones, my hobbies and interests, and my personal life. In this job, I am unable to do so.\n\n-Social media and constant attachment to technology have enabled the worst behavior in students, as has neglectful parenting and lack of meaningful consequences from caregivers and administrators.\n\n-I should not feel like a failure. The system, administrators, parents and students have failed me and all other educators. Not the other way around.\n\n-I have been held to an unrealistic standard of accountability that is not present in professions that pay comparably.\n\n-I never want to work again in a profession where I have to force kids to do what they do not want to do. I got into teaching to share my love of the content, not to impose it. \n\n-I am sick and tired of conflict. I am an engaging and incredibly reasonable and accommodating educator. I actively try to avoid conflict, and express myself with the utmost patience. I am tired of entitled students that think their poor behavior is acceptable when it is NOT. I am tired of students exploiting my patience.\n\n-I am tired. Period. The breaks don't make up for the exertion of the job.\n\n-I have made some excellent relationships with students, ones that I will cherish forever. Still, I can find a better future for myself by working in a different profession.\n\nI. AM. DONE.",

And most of the parents act like they love me. But I've experienced how quickly that can change over absolutely nothing. It's not real. It never was and it never will be.

        "body": "TLDR; insane student has an insane incident, gets one day ISS, another less insane student has a less insane incident, gets 5 days OSS\n\nHiya folx, here for yet another absurd story of students going bananas and admin doing nothing. Would love advice if anyone has thoughts. \n\nProblem student, let\u2019s call him A, has been a massive problem all year. Loud, mildly violent, extremely antagonistic, thinks everyone is out to get him, etc etc. He clearly has some undiagnosed mental health issues that his guardians refuse to get him to see anyone for. He\u2019s kinda gotten a free pass all year because of that, especially since his grandma died in December. A little bit of leeway, fine, everyone has hard days. But no, admin literally gave him a *pass* that he can flash at any time to go see a guidance counselor. And he uses that like crazy, he jokes about getting out of class with it. I don\u2019t care too much because it gets the lil sociopath out of my room, but the fact that he\u2019s working the system and knows it irks me. I digress. \n\nYesterday A takes another student\u2019s (let\u2019s call him B) pencil. I tell him to give it back to which he responds \u201cno, he started it, why aren\u2019t you yelling at B?!\u201d I tell him I didn\u2019t see anything other than the pencil being grabbed and to give it back. He continues arguing until finally saying fine, then takes the mechanical pencil apart, and throws the pieces at B. I tell A to go to the hall. He says no, argues, etc, so I call to have someone come get him. While I\u2019m on the phone, A takes all B\u2019s belongings. He also threatens B, saying he\u2019s going to bash B\u2019s head in. I finally get ahold of someone as A is realizing the jig is up and is packing up to go. He puts B\u2019s things back on his desk, then pushes it all onto the ground before walking out. Great. I pick it up, apologize, then B tells me A took his research packet we\u2019ve been working on for a month that\u2019s worth 60 points. Come to find out soon after, A ripped it up then *defiant vomited on the pieces*. I wrote him up for all of this obvi and documented thoroughly. \n\nThis morning received word that A got a 1 day ISS. At the end of the day, received word that a completely unrelated (but also psychotic but significantly less psychotic) student received a 5 day OSS for making threats. I don\u2019t know more details, I don\u2019t know the severity of the threat. But A made a threat too, and that\u2019s only what he did yesterday. He *routinely threatens other students* and will start the occasional, if weak, fight. The ISS he received is the first true discipline he\u2019s received since October. \n\nConsidering asking other teachers who are tired of A\u2019s bullshit to come with me to meet with admin. Also, I\u2019m in PA, union state.",

We talked about alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, and drugs (duh). The students, of course, asked how much of each I consumed and I told them I might have a beer once a month, but I don't drink caffeine nor do I smoke anything.\n\nOne of the students then said that I was showing \"white privilege\" by choosing not to smoke. Her words: \"Society expects black people to smoke and the majority of marketing targets us, so you have white privilege by not smoking.\" What?? \ud83d\ude02 When I asked her to explain this reasoning, she went into a long tirade about different things, some valid and some stretching, and she also said that my choosing to not have kids (I'm open about this) is also white privilege and is inherently racist.\n\nDude...how do you even deal with this one?? Lol she's always been more of a \"woke\" student and an awesome person to have in conversations during class, but today was something else entirely.\n\nHave any of you experienced this sort of thing before?

        "body": "TLDR: I want to get a teaching certificate in AZ but don't live in AZ and I'm not planning to teach in person. Can I still get the certificate without living there?\n\nLong version:\n\nI've been a children's minister for almost 18 years now and, due to that experience, I was offered and held jobs at a couple private religious schools teaching secular subject matter. I have a teaching credential through a Christian education association (ACTS) but never earned a state license because I didn't study education in college nor did I complete a teacher prep program. CA doesn't require private schools to mandate state teaching licenses, so it's never been a problem.\n\nMy husband and I have been traveling and we are planning to start a family soon, so I don't want to go back to full-time teaching right now. I'm currently writing and selling curriculum (a la TPT and my own website) and thinking about tutoring as a side gig as well. I recently had an opportunity come up to tutor online but was passed over because I don't hold a state credential. I'm also considering going back to school to get a master's in instructional technology, and some programs I've looked at require a teaching credential (in any subject matter).\n\nBecause I'm not planning to teach in a public school or even full-time right now at all, I'd rather not enroll in a teacher prep program and have to do student teaching or obtain a license through an internship at a public school. I saw that Arizona will issue a \"subject matter expert\" credential with not much more than a degree in an approved subject. However, I can't find on the AZ website if living in AZ is a requirement. I can't even access the application until I get fingerprint clearance, which I don't want to pay for if I can't get the license.\n\nSo does anyone know if AZ requires residency to get the certificate?",

Our school acquired thousands of dollars worth of books under the branch of offering books with, \u201cdiversity and offering multiple perspectives.\u201d Great! I was super excited for these hardback, multiple copies that student could read.\n\nI have a policy though. I vet every book that is in my classroom, meaning I read them all before adding them. I look for things like inappropriate words (swearing, slurs, etc) or scenes (gore, sex, genitalia, etc). My logic is if it would be a pg-13 movie, it probably has zero business in an elementary school.\n\nImagine my surprise when not 1, not 2, but 16 of the books feel into the not age appropriate category. Starting middle school characters going through puberty and dealing with a multitude of mature issues, I became highly concerned.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: Admin is claiming denying these books from being put into the SCHOOL library for ALL AGES would be book banning. My opinion is that filtering materials students are exposed to at school via age appropriateness is not book banning. It's the responsible thing to do as an educator. \n\nIs anyone else dealing with this? What are your thoughts? How would you handle this?",

        "body": "This year I've had a lot of students in extracurriculars like band, theater and orchestra (as well as sports). As a highschool student I took IB classes as well as being in several extracurriculars, but it was understood that extracurriculars could never be used as an excuse to academically fall behind. This year my students have been using preparing for extracurriculars events as an excuse for missing and late work. At first I was understanding, but as of late I've become frustrated by having to grade late work and make sure the students remember missing assignments. Today I emailed a music director (students are preparing for a large competition) because nearly all the students in said program have either turned in late work, or unfinished work the past two weeks. I feel like the music director thought I was blaming him, but I was just trying to get across that I think students need a reminder to keep on top of their coursework (especially since I teach an advanced class with tight deadlines). In the past I've had the same problem with theater kids neglecting deadlines, and I'm not sure how to handle the situation. Most of them are good students when they aren't preparing for an event, however, when they are I've had many get quite behind. I feel bad for emailing the director, but the students have known about tomorrow's  important deadline for 2 months, and yet I've still been hearing \"after school practice\" as an excuse for why they can't get the simple broken down pieces in order to submit. \n\nDoes anyone have a good way of dealing with this? I know high schoolers are often passionate about performing and competing, but it seems like it is coming at a cost. I don't want to make any performing arts teachers feel like I'm blaming them... but it's literally been all my students in said music program using after school practice as an excuse while this competition is in swing. I even had a parent email me that their kid should get full credit for a several day late assignment because of practice! Anyone deal with the same? Got a solution?",

Mainly with the ICS teacher who I am also working beside. (Basically I have 1 cooperating teacher and an ICS special ed teacher) I am in an ICS English class with freshman. While they are nice for the most part, every time I make a mistake it feels like the end of the world.

I understand I made a mistake but apologizing seems like it never works. Like she will say it's okay but it's clear that she is pissed at me. The problem was solved quickly and easily, but even still they both act like it's the end of the world.

I began to cry. A grown ass man crying in front of these students. They felt bad, I felt awful, and I know I\u2019m not able to give them my best possible self to them. I understand that I\u2019m not an expert whatsoever, but holy cannoli I have spoken with admin about anxiety and I have been having relapses in therapy. I\u2019m brand new, and I already want to give up. \n\nThis past week, the same class, they showed up and tried their best to engage with me and then ended up getting frustrated. A fight broke out between students due to one egging on another, and I called the office to have some support for resetting the room. This is my second month here, I\u2019m new, idk wtf I am doing. No one in office answered the phone again. I was told I can call the office anytime I need help, but no one answers, almost specifically for certain classes that \u201cno one wants to deal with.\u201d Is this normal!?\n\nThe kids are agitated, they have had 4 music teachers in the past 2 years. They are fed up. I get it!!! I don\u2019t blame anyone for leaving. The children have behaviors and trauma to grow through, but the staff is tired, and it is infectious.",

        "title": "1st Year Teacher Already Ready to Quit",
        "body": "I teach in North Texas, 7th and 8th grade RLA. I have wanted to be a a teacher my whole life. I went to college for literature, minor in educational psychology, and successfully completed the educational courses, including student teaching. I got hired to teach RLA at the school student taught at. I also substitute taught in this district for about 3 years throughout college. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to scheduling issues, I am finishing up my degree in university at the same as teaching. I finished all my ed classes and passed my exams, and just have a few random things like Texas government to take. The school district was aware of this when I applied and said they would work with me and want me to teach for them badly enough that they'll find a way to make it work. I was naive and trusted my principal when she told me this. I was so happy to finally be living my dream job, even though I was aware of the issues in schools, after student teaching. I student taught GT and Advanced classes, but now I teach 2 on-level and 1 Advanced class. I was completely unprepared what the truth of on-level classes are like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found out the day before the first day of school in August that I am not getting to be a normal teacher. I have the bs job title of Associate Teacher. This means I am not on a contract, I don't get paid salary, I have no benefits, I only get paid a daily rate. This means during breaks I don't get paid, when everyone else does. I have the same responsibilities of other teachers. I plan and teach, administer standardized assessments, get principal walk-throughs, have duty and tutoring (before and/or after school, but I'm only allowed to be paid for school hours (7:40-3:40). My daily rate is much less than the daily rate of a regular teacher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am struggling financially, because I lose so many days of work to breaks and long weekends, snow days, etc. When I am sick, I don't get paid for a sick day. When I accepted the job offer from the principal, it was under the guise that I was going to have treatment like a regular teacher. I suppose I should have asked for these details right away, I just thought it would all work out because I was told they're going to work with me to get me teaching properly, despite finishing up my degree. I just believed them, and was blindsided. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite the issues I have with being paid, I also have a terrible time teaching. Most of my complaints are within my On Level 8th grade classes. A majority of my students sit there and do absolutely nothing. I spend so much time creating and teaching lessons, just to get nothing back. However, my department has a policy that minor grades cannot be a 0, the lowest they can get is a 50. But major grades that we spend many in-class days on, those may be 0s. I see students for 90 min a day 5 days a week, more than any other subject, so I don't assign homework. My standards are so low, because they are skewed by a 50 meaning turning in nothing. It is painfully easy to have an A in my class. However, I have kids who turned in nothing at all for third quarter. So many students missing 19 of 19 assignments, or 18 or 17. Reaching out to home doesn't work. Their principals don't work. Losing privileges in my class doesn't work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorse than that, the behaviors are horrible. Kids cursing, telling me \"no\" when I ask them to do work or go sit down, etc. They try chasing each other. They'll do anything to bypass monitoring on their computers to play crappy browser games. Lunch detention, ISS, OSS, nothing makes a difference. There are times where I have called a principal to my room for help and they tell me no. We are so short staffed, that sometimes ISS is cancelled because there's nobody to cover it. The kids run this school and they know it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to fail a kid below a 60, you need to jump through a bunch of hoops documenting your parent communication, requesting the kid to go to tutoring, noting the child's attendance, etc, and get it signed off on by their principal. For Q3, I jumped through all the hoops so that my students can get the 28s, 17s, 30s, whatever grade they earned. The principals essentially told me that I am ruining their chances of moving on to 9th grade, can I please find something in the child to hold on hope for, they don't typically allow grades that low and can't I just bump them up to a 60? So all my grades became 60s. I feel horribly unethical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant. I am 4 days into Q4 and I don't know how I will hang on till May. I'm worried about the fact that I don't even have a summer income promised. I went through hell this year and don't even get to reap the single benefit of teaching. I just turned 23 and I feel ready to leave the career as soon as the year ends. I know the pay stuff is \"supposed\" to be fixed next school year because I'll be graduated, but I know that storms are abrewing and we are losing funding, and there's talks of pay freezes. I don't trust the district that they'll pay me the proper wage even though my job title would be changed. I don't know if I should give the school another chance next year, try a new school or district, or just find a new career altogether. I feel painfully disheartened. After knowing for 10 years I was meant to be an English teacher, and working towards this goal for my full school and professional life, now that I'm here, I hate it more than I thought possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdvice appreciated, or at least just commiserating.",

        "body": "So I've spent nearly 10+ years as a tutor and a paraprofessional and was given much motivation to try as a teacher. Thinking I wasn't making enough as a para and a tutor, I quit both to be a custodian to go back to school to teach.. well I tried out student teaching, and everything went fine. No issues, but I noticed a couple of things. I burned out this passion to help students/kids. It wasn't rewarding and I missed the decompression of working as a custodian. To come in and mentally clock out was so great. I made a little less than teachers, but it was so worth it as a custodian. \n\nWhat's embarrassing is that I left student teaching. People look at me differently as if I couldn't handle the job. I could handle it, I just didn't enjoy it. Those who criticized me were those who been in the profession for years and bitched about their job. And I just didn't want to fake this passion anymore. I just didn't want to do it anymore knowing I was in an environment that didn't care when I should care. I didn't want to invest in a career that brings work home everyday and does more work outside of the classroom. There's this unspoken obligation teacher's role that just wasn't appealing anymore that I quit. Idk if that's more of a me issue, but I just knew teaching isn't as rewarding nor fulfilling of a salary then I imagined. I just wonder if this feeling is normal or that other teachers casually feel about their everyday role?",

        "body": "My gf is an art teacher at a public high school. She is attractive and as per usual there are kids that will make weird comments, flirt obnoxiously with her inappropriately from time to time in front of friends, pretty common stuff I remember from my high school days, your basic attention seeking behavior or overconfident teens acting out. However there is one students that is starting to concern us a little bit and we don't know what to do. During her planning period every day he comes to the front door of her classroom. He literally just stares in the window or tried to interact with her if the door is open. Every day. Like every single day. This planning period lasts like 50 whole minutes and he will be there the whole time. In many other class periods he catches her skipping other classes just to stare in the window of the classroom door at her. If she leaves or the door is unlocked he will come in and ask her the same few questions just to talk to her. Stuff like can I have a pen for my next class? If she politely tells him she needs this time for planning her other classes he just goes \"i don't know\".\n\nShe has confirmed this student is low IQ. Apparently she has told administration but they are saying their hands are tied because he isn't technically doing anything wrong and the nature of his IQ explains his behavior. She has reached out to his parents multiple times with no response. We are trying to be as sensitive as possible to this situation but she it is really messing with her workflow and in the rest of the world this would be considering stalking like behavior. Does anyone have any ideas as to what to do with this situation? Thank you in advance.",

I\u2019m currently getting my MLL cert and am mostly asking because I want to do a project for my program on some of the buzzwords that get conflated at best, weaponized at worst, by admin in the name of \u201cequity.\u201d But, this is also something I (and I know many of us, based on my lurking) have been feeling deeply lately\u2026\nThe intense pressure to ~make up for learning loss~, up the \u201crigor\u201d (which just seems to be whatever newfangled program they seem to have recently spent all the district big bucks on), keep high expectations (as if my expectations can just *will* an ELL student reading at a 1st grade level to score high on standardized tests??). If we go at a pace that *actually* teaches things meaningfully, we\u2019re told our kids fail because we don\u2019t have a growth mindset. That they will rise to the occasion\u2026. I\u2019m exhausted. So are my kids. \nAnd now, with testing season coming up, the rhetoric that standardized test scores reflect our work towards \u201cequity\u201d for our marginalized students REALLY fires me up.\nI\u2019ve got many older, longer publications that problematize standardized tests, discuss what \u201cequity\u201d actually means, etc., but I\u2019m wondering if anyone can link any more recent, post-covid era articles about the impact of this kind of thing.

        "body": "I'm hoping I can get some insight on how to handle this. I was a Connecticut teacher for 6 years, so have accumulated a bit of retirement through the CT Teachers Retirement Board (TRB). Just last year I transitioned out of the classroom and got an instructional design job in the corporate world. I have a retirement account through Fidelity now. I'm trying to roll over what I've accumulated in my teachers retirement into the new Fidelity account. CT TRB is saying they need this form filled out in order to initiate the rollover and on this form, Fidelity has a section they would need to sign off on. Fidelity is saying they've never heard of such a process and that CT TRB just needs to roll over the money to them, making it sounds like it should be a quick, easy process. I'm kind of at a standstill because each party will not do what the other is saying needs to be done because they each have their own process. Has anyone in CT left teaching to go into the corporate world and successfully made this kind of transfer with their retirement? Do I even need to transfer the funds? Will I lose them if I don't? Sorry if these seem like ignorant questions. I will admit, when it comes to finance and retirement especially, I am a little lost on the subject. Any advice is appreciated!",

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nI'm looking for some insight or perspective. My district has their deadline approaching for Internal Transfers. I've been the teacher in a Self-contained elementary classroom for 8 years now. 3 &amp; 1/2 years in a resource room before that. I have an elem Ed degree and a sped degree (B.A.S &amp; M.S respectively). I've been contemplating and now am looking at applying for a general Ed classroom for next year.\n\nI want a bigger group of kids to work with who are the same age, roughly, and who I can be more creative with. Self-contained has been an incredible learning experience and career move but I'm thinking a change is needed for my own self. I don't get to teach as often as I like. I supervise adults, lead meetings, complete paperwork, and work on interventions, behaviorally and academic, much more often than teach kids.\n\nAnyone else with a similar background or insight into this? It's exciting to think about various lessons I could do with a group of kids on reading or math, ways to access the community with them that I don't get to with my current group (safety is typically why I don't do field trips), and a multitude of other things I could do with a more typical group.\n\nOf course, my current admin has been supportive over the years but I do worry about blowback simply for even trying to leave. And frankly, the team of paras, social worker, and just a good school environment would be hard to leave. I just want to try. I got into education to teach and work with kids and I find myself not doing that as much along with the classroom being used as a warehouse, at times, for aggressive kids. Idk, I am hoping for some honest feedback from a community of fellow teachers. Thanks!",

What is it for? What does it represent? Why do we assign it?\n\nTeachers at my site don't like the 50% floor policy. We feel like it is unfair and deceptive to award the same grade to students who:\n\n* Do nothing\n\n* Do half the assignment correctly \n\n* Or only do half the assignment half incorrently \n\nThe 59% F DOES seem appropriate to me. I can't think of a single thing where doing less than 60% of something should be passable. In the real world, people depend on each other, whether at a job or socially. \n\nI know YOU don't need me to explain this, but apparently some people do (and get really angry when you do say this): society can't function if people don't show up on time. Even something as simple as a small grocery store relies heavily on people being on time and doing ALL aspects of their job. You can't open the store or stock the shelves if the workers don't show up. You can't stock the shelves if the delivery drivers show up when they want to. The delivery drivers can't deliver food if people don't show up. Stores won't stay open if people only load half the food.\n\nThe examples go on. We are not preparing young people to interact meaningfully in the real world. I understand the goal is to get more kids to pass and graduate, but what does that mean if we just inflate grades to the point where zero effort is required? How is the child being served? How is society being served? \n\nTLDR, what is the purpose of a grade and what does it represent to you?",

        "body": "I feel so stupid posting this. I'm an 8th grade teacher. I have one student in my third block who I just cannot handle anymore. She is a pro at throwing off my whole class- she randomly yells, runs out of the room, make inappropriate comments (she asked me if I gave good head once and then pretended she didn't know what it meant). If I'm talking she'll just start yelling random things and then say \"sorry, it was an impulsive thought\". She is in control of being out of control. Yesterday she stood up on a desk and jumped off of it. She's a class clown type and has the have the attention on her all of the time. \n\nI've tried everything- doing more interactive activities where students are up and moving, given her the opportunity to read/speak in front of the class, I've tried to have restorative talks where she just rolls her eyes at me. I have a strict classroom routine and students know exactly what to do when they come in, but this student for whatever reason cannot follow it like her peers. I've called home and mom accused me of targeting her child. Now her mom just ignores me when I try to call/message her. I've given up on that, my admin is so far behind on write ups that nothing is happening. I've sent her to the guidance counselor and have sent additional request so she can go back, our counselor is just busy with testing right now.\n\nThere was an antisemetic incident in my class last week (I'm jewish) and the word spread through the grade level pretty quickly. Earlier today, I heard this girl say something along the lines of \"you know why her nose is so big...\" and then she proceeded to tell me I need Jesus. I just feel so stuck. She does not act like this at all for her other teachers. I've had other teachers speak with her about her behavior too. I have another teaching coming in pretty inconsistently (not her fault-busy schedule) to help with that class when she can. She is a lifesaver. She keeps the student occupied and I can actually help the others students instead of just managing her behavior. I feel like I've reached my limit with her and I don't want to lose my cool in class.\n\nI'm typing this on my lunch break because I feel so hopeless. I cannot believe a 14 year old is causing me this much stress. I dread that class everyday because I never get to teach, I just have to manage her behavior. What do I do?",

        "body": " \n\n* Follow me with this line of logic: \n\n1. We are not the same person as we were 10 years ago. 5 years. 1 year. Yesterday.\n2. We change with time. Sometimes for the better; sometimes for the worse.\n3. The past informs us of who we are today.\n4. You can keep making the same mistakes, and that is what you will be known as. Or you can learn from them, and become a better person.\n5. Today, you are all new children. \n\n* However, let\u2019s talk about the children of yesterday\n\n1. Let me preface this by saying I am in a state of disbelief due to the reports I\u2019m hearing. No one would dare do what these reports claim. In order for me to maintain my faith in humanity, I have to believe it is not in the capabilities of these students.\n2. I have recently been informed of racist banter in my class. Uncensored use of the N word. \n3. This trimester covers classic literature, which has fantastical elements. I shouldn\u2019t have to be talking about race with ancient greek culture and medieval times (though it does exist in a minor way). If I was covering Mark Twain or Of Mice and Men, sure, that would be at the forefront, but this era of literature is not supposed to have any of that. \n4. The language that has been used has forced my hand. I have to talk about race in an era of literature that doesn\u2019t need it. All thanks to racist remarks.\n5. Luckily, I do not know who the person who uttered it. But if I did\u2013 they would have made me extremely upset\u2013 the person who they would have to be around everyday until the trimester ends. The trimester, just started. That\u2019s a long time to be around the person you upset.\n6. Saying the N-word, is unforgivable. In general, anytime I hear somebody say it, I instantly dislike them. I think they are a bad person. I think they have never learned from any of their mistakes. I will think they are a racist.\n7. Fortunate for yesterday\u2019s racist comments, I don\u2019t know who the person was. And it\u2019s great that the children of today, are not the children of yesterday. Hopefully, the child has learned their lesson, and are choosing not to identify as a racist. Such language can only come from racist, garbage excuses for what unfortunately is able to be called a human being, and I know that no one wants that associated with their identity\u2026 at least I hope not.\n8. If, however, said yesterday\u2019s racist would like to identify as racist, you have indeed made an enemy. \n\n* If I hear, any such language, be it racist, homophobic, or sexist (yes the andrew tater tot fans are included in this warning), I have been given the big guns from admin.\n\n1. They have informed me that there is no warnings for such language. You go straight to the office.\n2. Their words to me was \u201cthey will be dealt with in the most severe manner\u201d without much elaboration.\n3. I would like to one-up that: I will utilize everything in my power to ensure that you will be expelled. If I do not deem admins punishment severe enough, I will lay my job on the line. I will straight-up threaten to quit, if said hypothetical child is not expelled. With the teacher shortage going around, such a threat will carry a lot of weight. \n4. If that happens, not only will the hypothetical child be deemed racist by their peers, they will be forever known as the jerk who made the \u201cfun\u201d English teacher quit.\n5. It\u2019s enough to make you cringe yourself to sleep until you're in your 50s.\n6. Ohh but the horror does not stop there.\n7. If I ever see them outside of school, I will remind the hypothetical student of the cringeworthy behavior they exhibited while I taught them. \n8. If ever, said hypothetical student thinks they\u2019ll make themselves famous in the future, I will ensure that \u201ccancel culture\u201d will work its magic, and make you infamous instead of famous.\n\n* Again, I would like to emphasize that we are not the people we were yesterday. I have informed you of my terrible GPA in High School. I have plenty of cringe-worthy stories from my past that haunt me to this day. I have chosen not to be that cringe-lord and be somebody that people can like and respect. I went from being a hobo to graduating from the best university in the world to study English literature. If you pay attention in my class, and stop goofing off, I will get you on my level.\n* On a side note, the side conversations whilst I am lecturing is out of hand. No more warnings. Straight to the office. \n\nThis speech was delivered a notch bellow yelling. Some kids talked and laughed as I gave it, as I knew they would, and sent them straight to the office. I am done with this crap. This is California damnit.\n\nps: sorry if the flair is off. Not sure how to mark this post.",

Social media adds a layer of expectations on them both towards interactivity and requirements for the approval of strangers that society has never had to contend with. Kids will lose their minds if they cannot reply to texts, comment, etc.\n\nI tire of teachers trying to brush this away as \"just the next little problem kids will figure out.\" I teach juniors and seniors.

Perhaps it's because the drama teacher and lots of students are watching them. There are lots of fights but 95% of them are 2 people hugging each other surroundeded by 100 people circling them. Before long, at least 10 teachers push through the crowd and try to stop the fight and disperse the crowd. The other 5% involves drugs and sharp instruments, and that's where the police might get involved.\n\nIf you happen to be the smartest, or the friendliest kid in your class, many people would, and only, come to you, beg for help and ask for school equipment throughout the academic year. If you accept, they take advantage of you and never owe you anything back. If you refuse even after helping them a lot, then they would throw a temper tantrum and hold a grudge against you, and now you have to watch your back. This is something I experienced firsthand, and I remember one time that when I refused to a beggar, they responded \"We only want help.\" Look here. I helped you so many times, and you took it for granted. You don't deserve help. You earn it.\n\nSorry for the vent. However, this only goes to show that there is a downside to kindness. People only recognise your existence when they WANT something from you. And this isn't a matter of there's things much worse than this. I don't care about that.\n\nAfter secondary school, everyone complains that everyone else was fake, while wearing puff coats and airpods, awkwardly glued and addicted to their phones and social media, following trends like Ohio memes. Nowadays, most people have hands in their pockets and some have their hoods on even when it's not raining.\n\nNow considering all of this and the vague comments in my last post, [state secondary schools in the UK are fragmented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/11m5lb6/state_secondary_schools_in_the_uk_are_fragmented/), it appears that many teachers would still be in denial of all of this. Maybe they are too busy to process and understand what is going on. Even so, whatever the teachers have to go through, that doesn't justify them to make students go through a horrible fate like this. Why do so many people tell others to stop complaining, when pretty much everyone complains about fake people and the government all the time?!",

The young man confessed first, the video having been found on his phone by another teacher. He was the camera man, and confessed to getting paid to film, amount undisclosed to me. The 6 young ladies were  the smashers of the piece, their reason it was fun.  When pressed the young man squealed and named names. He was given 5 days suspension for his actions of filming. The young ladies who were clearly on video doing the smashing, named and eventually also confessed when they saw the video. They received no punishment and were returned to class the very next day now I have to stare them in the face every third period knowing what they did.

When using AI-powered tools in the classroom, have you ever noticed that sometimes the responses aren't quite what you expected or needed? Well, we can actually help improve these responses and make them more accurate by correcting them with a thumbs down!\n\nMany AI-powered tools have a thumbs down option that lets users indicate when a response is incorrect or doesn't meet their needs. When you correct a response with a thumbs down, you're helping to provide valuable feedback to the AI system, which can learn from these corrections and improve its responses over time.\n\nSo, let's make it a fun and collaborative effort to correct responses with thumbs down when we notice errors or inaccuracies. Encourage your students to do the same, and let's work together to help improve AI responses in the classroom and beyond. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see the fruits of our collaborative efforts reflected in even better AI technology!\n\nHave you tried correcting AI responses with thumbs down? How has it worked for you? Share your experiences and let's continue the conversation!",

I dropped out of school for almost 2 years and started working as a para. I loved it in the beginning, decided to go back to school to teach elementary/special education. A couple years into it, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I quit on my lunch break and never went back. Education wasn\u2019t what I thought it was at the beginning. I have absolutely no desire to work in a school again, especially a public school. I\u2019m on a 3 month term break right now to adjust my timeline and all I have left to do when I return is student teaching. The thing is, I have no motivation to go back. I ended up starting a small business during this break because I couldn\u2019t find a job that would hire me for 3 months and it has turned out to work very well for me. It\u2019s lucrative, rewarding, and I get to travel the country with family at the client\u2019s expense. \n\nMy reserve to quitting school is that it would be nice having a degree to fall back on if I need it. I know I don\u2019t necessarily have use it at a school, but I also don\u2019t want a regular 9-5 job. I\u2019ve really enjoyed doing things on my own time and being my own boss. BUT I\u2019m almost done!! Another downside is that I\u2019ll have no choice but to put my business on hold to student teach. I also no longer work for a school, so I won\u2019t be getting paid during that time and working at night after school hours will be very hard. Possible, but hard.

Thursday and Tuesday I have a window in the morning, but no break from 1pm to 9pm, and I still work Fridays' afternoons (no breaks) and Saturdays' mornings (also no breaks). Here we get paid by the hour, but no extra payment is given for \"extra hours\". Legally speaking no teacher here exists.\n\nYesterday I got terribly sick during the afternoon classes. I warned admin that I would be giving the next 2 classes (so he would have time to warn students and try to find a replacement) and then I would be going home. He asked if I was sure because another 3 teachers were also sick and away. I said I was and went back to the student already in the classroom.\n\nI am calling him \"admin\" but he would be something more like just a plain old boss, and he is also the owner of the school. I am the teacher that works the most at this school, but the others don't have it easy either. The point is I have had stress-related diseases in the past and I recognize the symptoms. Yesterday I got home at 6pm and managed to do nothing besides sleeping until 6am today. The headache and nausea felt a lot like my stress-induced pains in the past. Even the cleaning lady was throwing up due to stress yesterday, after being called out for \"not doing her job\" when she not only does her job perfectly but also stays in the front desk when we have no one to stay there and doubles as security because he fired security and refuses to hire anyone new.\n\nMy point is, I am not in the financial condition that would allow me to just leave this place. But admin seems to not realize that he is exploring his workers so much they are starting to get phisically ill. I am looking for new jobs, but in the meanwhile, should I try to see him notice that? Or should I just try to avoid interacting with him? How could I talk to him to make him notice it?\n\nKeep in mind that when I said I needed lunch and dinner breaks and wouldn't be accepting more classes he apparently waited for me to leave and started throwing chairs at the walls, and whenever a teacher gets sick or quits he starts to talk shit about them to anyone who would listen, and he constantly lies to students as to why their teachers keep getting replaced. He also has a habit of charging students for classes they missed but not paying said teachers for said classes because the teachers didn't have to work.",

        "body": "Student-teacher here and I'll appreciate any advice you have. \n\nI currently tutor this one online student who I find more difficult to get along with than all my other students. Granted, my other students are all taught in-person so I'm aware the natural awkwardness of online teaching could very much be a factor. \n\nMy challenge is I don't know how to build a rapport with this grade 5 student when she displays clear signs of disinterest and attitude through her tone. I'm not sure of she is self aware of the blatancy of her 'attitude' as she is a kid after all. Either way there is no doubt that she sometimes feels disinterested or annoyed. \n\nFor example in today's lesson I tried to give her a friendly hint to which she'll reply 'I know! ' in an annoyed tone (and proceeded to get the question wrong). Also for reading comprehension I would encourage her to read aloud but she speeds and slurs through the passage as if it's a complete waste of her time. I later gave her the choice to read to herself or aloud and she chose to read to herself and went ahead and did the questions herself too. I felt like I wasn't of any help to her at this point. \n\nI've tried incoporating different teaching methods to hopefully make the lesson more engaging. I pretend as if I'm unaware when she gives me the attitude tone but I honestly wish I knew what else to do.",

(For NQT\u2019s, it IS possible to land an international school job right after certification.)\n\nThe bad news: The teacher I was going to take over for next year has unexpectedly decided to quit. I was supposed to be a support teacher for the last term of the current academic year to get my bearings straight before next year, but now I will be taking on a full course load starting in April. \n\nI\u2019m super excited to be starting, but I\u2019m a bit nervous at the same time because I\u2019ve never taught Secondary Math (years 7-10, which I believe is key stage 3 and 4?), let alone taken over for someone in last term of a year, and let alone at an IB international school. My subject area certification is in Business Education, so I guess I\u2019m just nervous about teaching this level of math for the first time. \n\nThe school is fairly new and they are trying to raise the student exam scores after the slump from covid. When I take over, I really want to give the students the best possible chance of success. \n\nFor any Secondary Math Teachers out there with experience teaching IB, do you have any pointers for me to prepare for taking over another teacher\u2019s classes mid-year? \n\nTIA!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

For the first time ever, there are paras in my room.\n\nI teach high school, so there are several paras that I work with for different classes which are basically inclusion classes. One has expressed concerns that the work is too complex for them.  She said the whole class complained to her today that my work is too hard and basically that I'm not as easy as the other teachers. She asked for me to keep in mind that the kids are graduating in a matter of weeks. \n\nHaving started my career initially as an interim sub mid-year to seniors, I've been here before.  They're harder to motivate, don't see me as their teacher, and the teacher who was on her way out gave 'em 100's for anything they turn in, but now I'm trying to like, actually teach.  (I've also had several admin in my room and received high marks in my observation.)\n\nI get advocating for students, but I'm worried about the dynamic being set up; I'm not sure that I'm being backed up as a teacher when I'm not in the room, like today.  I'm a bit put off, but I can't put my finger on how to explain why.",

My classroom management gets compliments almost everyday. \nHowever, I got a new student from a different title one school who got kicked out from special permission due to behavior. \nHow do I work with her? How do I make sure my kids are a good influence? Some of my kids are sneaky and I want her to have a fresh start. I\u2019m trying to ignore all the bad things I heard about her and start over with her. Tomorrow when the other kids are at gym I think I\u2019m going to hold her back and just talk to her and get to know her. I\u2019m worried my whole class dynamic is going to flip. It\u2019s testing right now too so they are already a little hyper due to change of schedule with testing. \n\nThanks!",

Our pay already wasn't great and now is not even close to keeping up with inflation. Teachers are burnt out and are leaving the extra duties behind where they are often volunteers or paid very little for their time. Around me if you coach anything other than football you are lucky to make $5k as a head coach for the season and $2k as an assistant. This is for around 250-300 hours worth of work plus a lot of extra responsibilities. \n\nMany of these roles are fundamental to creating memorable high school experiences (sports, clubs, recitals, prom, homecoming, etc) and I'm already seeing them slowly fade out.",

I differentiate a ton, more than almost anyone else in my building. I\u2019m strict but fair with class management and have very high expectations of my students. This subject is my passion, and I love the kids. I am always looking for feedback and ways to improve. There\u2019s people (admin, staff, visitors) observing in my room almost every week. \n\nOut of my 80 kids, 4 are failing. Combo of chronically absent, or being referred for possible reading disability. \n\nSome of my peers are annoyed that so many kids are passing. They think more kids should be heading to summer school. What the fuck? I have worked my tail off to get where I am, no one else in the entire county is attempting to teach some of the difficult texts I\u2019m doing in my class\u2026but the kicker is that my students totally deserve their grades. I haven\u2019t needed to write a single disciplinary referral for my classes all year (I have for incidents in the hallway/cafeteria). My benchmark tests show strong growth overall. My students genuinely do their work and have a positive attitude. I\u2019ve made over 90 parent phone calls/texts this year \u2014 which I only mention because I think it really helps me with class management. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re not doing enough work for you, but I\u2019m not going to start arbitrarily failing students who do their work and then some.\n\nJust needed to rant because even if you manage to spend years trying to improve and get things right, people will STILL bitch.",

        "title": "Kindergarten class has gone downhill with behavior these past few weeks- any advice?",
        "body": "I have a pretty active class (Title 1, 2/3 boys, rough area). Mostly, we're able to have decent days and get our work done. Everyone's fairly happy and aside from a few major behavior problems they're not too bad. Lately, though (mid-to-late February til now) I'm seeing a major increase in bad behaviors and I'm really struggling to get them back on track. Here's what's going on:\n\nTwo girls have been coming in every morning for the past week or so angry as HELL the moment they arrive. Nothing happens in the hallway, nothing is different. We've talked about it.  But it's instant flopping on the floor, moaning, refusing to follow directions and then crying/hiding when they're reprimanded. They're sent to the safe space to cool off, which they usually mess up. Eventually they're able to get themselves together and rejoin us and are fine (usually after being given a job to do and after cleaning up the safe space) but CHRIST. \n\nThere's a group of boys in my class who won't leave each other the hell alone. They've always been mild troublemakers but it's been manageable. Now they're off the wall. Separate tables, separate rug rows, monitored closely by my aide when she's here..there's always a rude comment, a sneaky punch, or a chase around the room. Parents have been called. Recess has been missed. We go over SEL and procedures DAILY. Now they're all getting on behavior plans where they'll have to earn recess each day by meeting a goal. Again, they'll run off, cry, and pout for days at the slightest reprimand.\n\nAnd recess. Every day I come out to half of them doing okay and the other half screaming to tattle or grounded on the bench for bad behavior. It's so embarrassing to be flooded with bad comments the second I get out there. They've always been a little wild at recess but nothing like this. Used to be I had one issue a day, maybe every other. Now it's multiple issues daily, even with kids who are normally well-behaved.\n\n**Changes:**  \nTwo of my very severe kids (elopers, hit adults, tantrums) have been removed to ED rooms/different schools. It's been easier without them here, but I don't doubt that there's been trauma after seeing their rage. The others were all a little on edge when the boys there because they'd get set off very easily, but now that they know they're not coming back they're letting loose.\n\nMy newest student isn't at that level, but she does start drama and has needed to be moved a few times after hitting and cussing at others at her table. One of them (the first girl I mentioned) has gone along with and copied her behavior after being mostly fine all year.\n\nWe got a part-time aide! This is amazing. I normally use her to pull my mid-to-low level students for letters and sight words and sit with my rowdier kids at centers. This has been working great for them and it's where she's the most needed. But my higher kids and those with great behavior are getting pouty and jealous because they're not pulled (we only have her a few hours a day so I want to give the help to those who really need it).\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\nSeating chart swaps (all of the troublemakers are separated and we have assigned rows on the rug).\n\nDaily procedures review AND not going anywhere/doing anything until they're showing correct behaviors. We've been late a lot these past few weeks.\n\nRewarding the hell out of the kids who are showing good behavior (we have a clip chart system for our school so I clip them up when I see them doing things right.\n\nTaking away recess for violent or very disruptive recess. If I get told that a student causes problems at recess they automatically miss the next one. I don't take it away for the whole class.\n\nIncentives: 5 stars for good recess behavior (everyone in line, hands to self, no bad reports) means a prize. I won't give it to those who have had to miss recess for bad behavior.\n\nSEL support. A few students have visited the counselor (new one included) for anger management strategies.\n\nSafe space/positive alternatives (usually pushing in chairs, cleaning the floor, or hanging up coats for a kid who isn't ready to join in but needs to move around.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I know it's almost spring break but this is ridiculous. I feel worst for my good kids who are surrounded by foolish behavior and annoyed that it's MARCH and they're acting brand-new. I also hate not being able to have as much fun with them because I just can't trust them to behave.",

I was aware that I would be getting one, but I was told that it would only be for one concern, and it ended up being 6 separate concerns when I actually received it. Here is the problem. 2 of the items of concern were \u201cdifficulty processing information and directions\u201d and \u201ctrouble remembering directions\u201d. Here is the problem. I have been diagnosed with Autism which is a processing disorder, and these are things that I have struggled with for 23 years, and I will struggle with them for the rest of my life, yet my supervisor wants me to significantly improve on those within 9 days. My supervisor knows that I have this condition, she has acknowledged it time after time, and even when I received the NOC she said that she knew I was trying my best, yet I\u2019m one step away from failing. I really feel like they\u2019re playing a game with me that I can\u2019t win. If I don\u2019t get certified or don\u2019t even pass, what are other options for me to be involved in some form of teaching? I firmly believe that I am qualified to do this as I have over 140 credits in college, and I believe that a more reasonable supervisor would understand that I am perfectly capable of doing all the aspects of the job and say that I am eligible for certification",

He has a LOT of issues, especially at home, and those issues transfer over into school. He fails classes and gets in fights but since thanksgiving I\u2019ve had him spend his free/study time with me so I can give him some stuff to keep him busy and tutor him. \n\nHis grades were rising and his behavior was improving. He only went to the office twice this year versus last year when he went 18 times! I even gave him a project to do and had him signed up for a competition outside of school in the subject I teach. \n\nWell, last week I was out of school. His grandma left him home alone all weekend so he walked two miles to school Monday in the same clothes he was wearing Friday. He went to an after school activity where food would be supplied, got into a fight, and pulled a knife out and threatened the life of another student. Thankfully, nobody was hurt, but it was scary. \n\nHe\u2019s been expelled, which I definitely think is right, but I can\u2019t help but feel terrible. He was dealt a bad hand in life and there\u2019s no telling what being home 24/7 with little supervision is going to do. I also have to go take back all of the stuff he was borrowing for the competition as he can no longer have it. \n\nIdk I just feel awful that he doesn\u2019t have the support to help deal with his emotions and he went to violence.

Hoping people might have some thoughts on how to proceed here.\n\nFor some context: I am currently a building sub at the school where I did my student teaching and was an LTS for my CT last semester. I have also been approached by my principal about the possibility of returning as a full-fledged teacher next year, if they have a position or can create one for me. No word on that just yet--he was very open about the fact that they are still shuffling things around and don't have full answers yet.\n\nMy partner and I are desperately in need of therapy. Like there is a very real possibility we will end the relationship if we don't start seeking help. I am, obviously, very sad and stressed right now, but I don't let it show at work for obvious reasons. As you may know, or can imagine, evening appointments are in extremely short supply. In fact, appointments are in short supply in general. I have not been able to find nearly anywhere that doesn't hit me with a \"we'll put you on the waitlist.\" Some places don't give me an idea of how long the wait is; one told me 6-8 months if a significant number of people don't drop off the list.\n\nThere's one therapist available, but her opening is Thursdays at 2pm. I would have to leave work at 1:30 to get there on time. This would likely be every other week. I offered the possibility to her \\[therapist\\] of starting in May so I would only have to leave early for the last month of school when I'll be needed less as a sub and will have time to approach my principal with the need. She, understandably, can't hold a slot for that long and told me she can waitlist me. Call back when we're ready and see if it's available, or she'll call me before then if something else opens up that works better.\n\nI'm legitimately afraid of waiting two months. That appointment slot will be gone, no question. I do not plan to teach this summer... so I could wait it out and hope something is open by then. Or I could go to my principal and discuss the possibility of an early leave every other Thursday through April and May and see if the therapist will hold the spot for a couple of weeks to start at spring break. I haven't ever been in this position and I don't really know what to do. My relationship is important to me, but so is my job, and I don't want to jeopardize it either. Anyone have any thoughts?

        "body": "Hello! I\u2019ve posted in here quite, but I am currently wondering how I could be certified to teach as a Gen Ed Teacher next school year? From previous posts, I am a first year teacher and really do not like being a SpED teacher. It has been incredibly tough and wish I have done more research on what the work entails. \n\nI currently have a 4 Year Residential Educator Intervention Specialist License, and so I am wondering if I would just need to pass a subject test and then apply for a license in that area? My background is in History, so I was thinking of going for ELA or History. \n\nI\u2019ve already let me principal know awhile back and he said he would be down for me to switch into Gen Ed if there were any open positions next year. I am just asking now so that I can be prepared and certified for next year. Some details I think I should note (if relevant) is that I did not go to school to become a teacher \u2014 I did an alternative route (TFA,) so i currently only hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nAnything helps!!!",

Writing five paragraph essays for homework, reading full chapters and taking notes on my own, studying math textbooks (taking notes and doing the questions at the end-- which I felt never prepared me)... only ten years ago. I graduated in 2015 and in 8th grade I was not tracked in any honors classes.\n\nWhen I was in grad school, I thought that good teachers would modify assignments over the years to account for student interest and the advancement of technology. I do this in my classes. I expect a lot from my students; I try to make engaging stuff that holds their interest, but that is also rigorous. I have a lot of failing students. Even this year, I find myself lowering standards on assessments to make up for it. \n\nI've been reading a lot of posts on this sub and engaging in conversations with my older colleagues where teachers are instead modifying the amount of work that students produce. And the amount of work that students have to put in. What's the consensus on this?",

Last fight we all met - admin, student, parent - and parent and student both agreed that if it happened again, despite our best efforts, our school may not be the best place for the student. \n\nWell, it happened. Planned and all. We met and found other schools ready to enroll that might better serve or give a fresh start. The parent and student eventually refused and said we can\u2019t do anything about it and the student better be back in class. \n\nBeyond that, the student made a plan to assault me and tried recruiting help. The hope was to get me to fight back and then lie about it and get me fired. This is documented. \n\nIf the network insists an alternative school or plan to give 1-on-1 instruction outside of regular classes are not acceptable, do I have any legal avenues to protect myself if I resign or feel unsafe at work? \n\nLast context: the student has an iep with emotional disturbance listed.",

The mom said it wasn't fair to be calling her daughter out in front of the other kids.  \n\nThis mom is so draining to me.  I wonder if she really is that naive, or if she's just in denial.  Or a little bit of both.  It's crazy.",

        "body": "Hi all - non-teacher parent here. Bless you all for the work you do, day in and day out, while being ridiculously underpaid. I recognize it is a stressful job, and dealing with children all day is just stressful in itself let alone all the other crap that comes your way....\n\nHence my question: when my fourth grader comes home for weeks on end telling me that her teacher yelled at the class again today, or that she made her feel stupid for asking a question or doing something wrong, or that she spoke to her or her friends \"rudely\" and \"in their face\" ..... is this something you as a teacher would want me, as a parent, to address? My 4th grader has specifically said that her teacher says how stressed out she is, and it's clearly manifesting with the way she's now treating the kids, and I'm unsure how to support this teacher while also supporting my kiddo. \n\nWould it be super weird to reach out to the teacher and say \"hey, my kid says that you've been stressed, has felt like you are always angry at them, is everything ok? is there anything I can do as a parent?\"\n\nOR would that just be super weird and/or pointless? \n\nI've already talked with my child about how when people are stressed out they are not always themselves, and that they can take it out on others and it's just about how THEY'RE feeling, not about the person they're taking it out on. She gets it as much as a 4th grader can. \n\nWhat do I do here? We've got three months left, so maybe I just leave it alone, but I can't imagine it's fun to be so stressed at your job that you yell at the kids out of frustration, and its not fun for the kids either. My older daughter had this same teacher 2 years ago and this never came up.\n\nGenuinely looking for perspective and advice here!",

If she was ill, I'd like to change that to an excused absence.\n\nYour Child has 12 tardies and she also has two period absences from first period and arrived during passing period for second.\n\nAs far as clearing tardies, parents and guardians are only allowed to clear one tardy per semester without a doctor's note. Our tardy policy is very standard as are the methods for clearing them. We can't hold her to a different standard because she performs better scholastically than other students. If you'd like to speak to someone about that, you'll have to speak with Mr. AP (who I am including in this email) as he oversees graduation and work permits.\n\nBest,\n\nAttendance Ambassador",

        "body": "For background, I have a BA in English with 160+ hours of substitute teaching experience in my district. \n\nI\u2019m currently in the process of refreshing my knowledge for the General Knowledge Test. My understanding was that the GKT is required in order to obtain a temporary certification. \n\nHowever, a number of teachers have contradicted me on this, saying that my BA, transcripts, and background check is all I need to get the temporary and I will have 2-3 years to take the requisite programs and tests. \n\nAfter asking around my network, the only thing I have learned is that most of my teacher friends have carved out their own unique paths that differ from my own (and so might not be applicable). Also, my district HR office is not returning calls or emails. \n\nCould someone set me straight on this? Not that I mind taking the GKT sooner rather than later, but if I could obtain my temporary sooner and delay the $130 bill and inconvenience, I would gladly do so.",

        "body": "Hello fellow teachers,\n\nI recently graduated with a mechanical engineering degree and have been working as an engineer for about nine months. However, I've been having doubts about my career path and am considering transitioning to education. I have always enjoyed the educational atmosphere and helping others, and have found that teaching math is something I could see myself doing long-term.\n\nI'm wondering what the process is like in Texas to become certified as a teacher after college without an education-related degree. I've heard of programs like iteachTEXAS, but I'm not sure where to start. Do I need to focus on specific certifications to teach STEM-related classes, or can I also teach other subjects with my engineering background?\n\nAny advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

        "body": "1) It is all about memorisation, not learning.\n\nIn English, you have MEMORISE at least 1,000 quotes from 3 or 4 texts, when only a dozen or two are used. There's only one single question from each text, where a random theme is chosen like russian roulette. In Maths and Sciences, you have to MEMORISE at least 1,000 equations and formulas, like the quadratic formula.\n\n2) School Rules\n\nSchool uniforms, no phones allowed (even during out of lessons), no going to the bathroom, no talking AT ALL or DETENTION!!! Apart from the teacher's pet, has anyone missed them?\n\n3) School Food\n\nSchool food is very unhealthy and does not teach students the importance of healthy eating. Responsible for 25% of adults in the UK being obese and many other health issues.\n\n4) Student Life\n\nA rife and lethal environment of pretence, bullying and fighting. After secondary school, everyone complains that everyone else was fake. I will explain these details in another post since this post is already too long.\n\n5) Physical Education\n\nThe changing rooms are tiny and overcrowded and the only sport that is played is football. Goalkeeper is perceived to be the lowest of the lowest in the social hierarchy, while everyone else runs for the ball.\n\n6) Assemblies\n\nI don't understand why the punishment for arriving late to assembly is harsher than arriving late to any other lessons, especially when some people rely on an inconsistent public transport and wake up early to make up this time. What makes assembly more important than any other lesson anyway? The assemblies don't teach us anything and doesn't prepare us for life.\n\n7) Teachers\n\nThey spend more hours combined attempting to discipline bad behaviour, marking student's work and making powerpoints than actually teaching the students. In addition to these long hours, they are underpaid and are having to use their wages and salaries to buy equipment for the students. All of this leads to a shortage of teachers and teacher strikes. Not to mention, many teachers have favourites.\n\n8) Exams, grades and grade boundaries.\n\nThere are too many grades in the grading system (9-1). Once you get into a college, an apprenticeship or any other equivalent, your grades won't matter anymore. Might as well use the A-Level grading system (A\\* to E and U). Also, the grade boundaries can be unrealistic because the exams are way too hard (e.g. they don't give enough time to students to complete the paper, this is not a time management issue).\n\n9) Ofsted\n\nThey tell schools when they are coming to inspect, then the schools tell the students when Ofsted is coming to inspect, so the students pretend to be on their best behaviour which Ofsted only sees, but this isn't a true representation of what schools actually are. This is a waste of money, which all of this could be used to actually pay the teachers.",

Kids are routinely told to and are made to feel obligated to incriminate themselves. \nAn example of this you hear with some regularity is, teachers forcing the class to stay silent, run laps, or holding kids past the bell until someone confesses to what they saw or did. The idea of \u201cwe\u2019re not continuing until the person who did that stands up\u201d. \nWhile it this tactic is effective, it instills the idea that if you\u2019re in trouble you should admit guilt and that it is acceptable to punish people for remaining silent. \n\nAnother major aspect of this problem is when one student apart of the same group is found to have broken a rule (ie: vaped, cheated, etc) many times his friends are punished because they have no proof they didn\u2019t also do xyz. Guilty by association is not legally enforceable yet schools justify taking away a child\u2019s right to education by suspending/expelling them on those grounds. \n\nAre these practices in line with what we hope to teach our future generations?

Context: I have a biology degree and will be interviewing for hs science teacher. This school has a 72% graduation rate. Anyone have tips other than \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d \ud83d\ude02 also, I have tattoos. I plan to wear long sleeves but am I worrying too much about them? They aren\u2019t insane or anything. So overall, what kind of questions should I ask and be prepped to answer? I\u2019m eager but don\u2019t want to just jump into the wrong school or situation. I\u2019ll be getting a tour of the school, as well. Also any other tips, resources, advice, warnings, etc are totally welcome and appreciated. Thanks all!",

        "body": "First-year high school teacher here, my favorite class (by FAR) to teach is Physics. It is literally *why* I became a teacher. Last Spring, I got hired by a school district that had a physics opening, but it was not until *after* I accepted the position that I was told that the school only had one (1!!!) physics class, and that my other 5 preps would be either electronics 1, electronics 2, or engineering. Apparently the previous physics teacher sucked and ran the program into the ground so no one wants to take it, but I was hoping to change that.\n\nI figured I could grow the physics program by doing a great job teaching it, which I was initially hopeful about. I feel like I did a very well teaching physics and that my kids learned a lot and had fun. Some students even told me I was the best teacher they'd ever had. Meanwhile, I was also stuck teaching electronics, which I absolutely hated. The kids weren't interested, the content was boring, and I don't have ANY electronics background so I'm pretty much forced to just teach the exact content I'm given. At the start of February, we got new classes (my school is on a 4x4 schedule) and I now have exclusively engineering and electronics classes. I hate teaching electronics and engineering is fine, but not nearly as fulfilling as physics.\n\nAnyways, today I was told by an assistant principal that I will probably just have one Physics class again next year. What now? Do I just leave the school? If I am not seeing any growth, when will that happen? Literally all of my physics students told me it was their favorite class and that they'd encourage their friends to take it, but clearly that didn't happen. I'm super bummed, not only because I apparently didn't do as well as I thought at starting the program, but because I also just don't want to teach these other electronics classes again. I talked with some admin and they recommended speaking with math/science classes about why those students should take physics and maybe some kids will make a last-minute schedule change, so I'm gonna try to do that over the next few weeks. Other than that, any advice?\n\nTLDR: I'm a first-year physics teacher but the school I'm at only has one physics class (not many kids take it). I thought I did a great job teaching physics so I was hoping more kids would sign up for next year but I just found out that I'll only have one physics class again. Will the program just never grow or should I stick it out for a few more years?",

        "title": "Just had the lesson from hell",
        "body": "I\u2019m a first year teacher trainee and I just had my worst lesson by far because of one student. This student is known for continually being disruptive and never doing any work, but today their behaviour transcended that and was completely abhorrent. \n\nIt started off as it normally does with them, constant talking and ignoring any and all instructions. Things escalated when they started making lots of inappropriate sexual comments. It began with them mimicking someone performing oral sex, with both hand motions and noises. They followed this up by loudly shouting \u201cI\u2019m gonna cum\u201d repeatedly in a woman\u2019s voice. The topic of charities came up in lesson, and one student said \u201cif I give a man a fish, he\u2019ll eat for a day. If I teach a man to fish, he\u2019ll eat for life\u201d. This student then responded to that by saying \u201cif I rape a woman I\u2019ll have sex for a day. If I kidnap a woman, I\u2019ll have sex for life\u201d. Later on, the topic of blood donation came up and they said \u201cI would never want to receive blood because there\u2019s a chance that it came from a man, and having a man\u2019s blood inside you is gay\u201d. Someone else asked them if anything would be wrong with that, and they said \u201cyes\u201d. \n\nVery early on whilst all of this was happening, I called for someone to come remove them from the lesson. The other teacher arrived to take them out, but they refused to leave. I had to continue teaching whilst the other teacher was trying to get them out, which was when most of this took place. The other teacher eventually left to go and get the head teacher. When they arrived back they finally managed to get them to leave 30 minutes into the lesson. \n\nI know as a first year trainee I need to learn to be able to deal with difficult behaviour, but everyone I\u2019ve spoken to about this has said they don\u2019t think I should be in this class at all and that it\u2019s way above what I should be dealing with right now. To make things worse, the other teacher that is normally in that class with me wasn\u2019t in today so the person that was accompanying me was a cover teacher who seemed just as ill equipped to deal with this as I was. This student is known by the school for their consistent terrible behaviour and they told me they\u2019re in the process of trying to figure out what to do with them, but apparently there\u2019s a lot of complications as they have a really bad home life. I can\u2019t help but feel they shouldn\u2019t be in mainstream education at all given the comments they made today (and the fact that they\u2019re apparently not out of character) because of the effect they could have on other students in the class.

        "body": "About a month ago, I was told that a female student (S) yelled at a male student (H) in the middle of class (not mine). He was messing around with a friend and his elbow almost hit her in the face. The issue was escalated to administration, both boys wrote apology letters to the student, and all parties involved admitted that there was no intent to harm (S included). S also received services from the counselor just in case.\n\nThis week, S asked me to stay late to talk. She told me that after the incident, she is annoyed that her peers are still being immature. I asked if they had been roughhousing (yes, but only outside and not near me). I asked if they retaliated against her (no, they just stay away from me). I asked if she felt unsafe on campus in any way (yes, because they\u2019re all so immature). She said that I had a duty to understand her because I\u2019m a petite female teacher.\n\nAs we\u2019re talking, her mother ambushed me (I have a strict appointment policy for parents) and started demanding that I, as a petite female teacher, force the entire school to have an anti-bullying rally. The bullying part came out of nowhere. Everything was an accident, and no further incidents have occurred. The principal already dealt with the situation a month ago, but now the parent is threatening to report the whole school to the district if I don\u2019t make the school host a rally. Our principal is out and we won\u2019t have any admin on campus for a while. Also, the mom has harassed our principal extensively in the past.\n\nI reported the incident to the counselor, but I\u2019m so confused about this whole situation. I truly want S to feel safe and I understand her frustration being around big guys horsing around. But trying to double jeopardize them? Saying it\u2019s bullying after she herself said it was accidental?\n\nIdk I\u2019d just love some alternate perspectives. I\u2019m a first year teacher and the ides of March is approaching, so I\u2019m pretty freaked out that I\u2019ve been dragged into drama that happened a month ago in a different class.",

I thought they were looking for an EFL teacher to work in middle school, but the principal told me during an interview that I'd be expected to teach the students the Catholic rituals so they can attend the holy mess that takes places in English.\nNot only am I not a religious person but also I didn't receive any formal instruction in teaching religious beliefs in English at university.\nSo I withdrew my application as I didn't think I was the teacher they needed.\nDo you think the school's admin is being cheap? It would be more appropriate to hire both an English teacher for the English classes and some English-speaking priest to teach the kids about the mess.",

I struggle with creativity when making my lessons, and truth be told a lot of the online resources I find are outdated and uninteresting, but ChatGPT is able to give me a solid foundation that I can build off of. When used as a tool, this is something that is revolutionary and should be celebrated. Students should be taught how to utilize this as a tool, it should not be gatekept. That being said, it is also dangerous, as you can use it to complete assignments. My approach? I've gone back to primarily paper and pencil in my classroom, even though my school is 1-to-1. Rarely do I give work to do outside of the classroom, and I monitor students' Chromebook usage during class-time. There is a balance to everything. So far, it's worked wonders.",

Students adore me as I am tough, but fair.\n\nHowever, an assistant principal has been targeting me. I was voluntold as a first year teacher to do yearbook this year. It has been a pain in my 's the only negative thing I have had. What makes it awful is that the AP over yearbook this year has been a bully. She speaks down to me as if I am an idiot. She tried to give me a bad observation, but couldn't because of how well my class did. Oh and this was when the internet went out. She makes me nervous whenever I speak to her. She never says hello and instead greets me by telling me something I did wrong according to her. This week she decided to interrupt my class twice and once during my planning to ask about the budget.\n\nI am not the only one who cannot stand this lady as most teachers have complained about her. I just do not know how to handle her. Do I go to the union and make a fuss?",

I left a sub note about it, but no idea if anything came of it.\n\nIn another class, I was helping a group with some math, and some at another table called for me, and when I looked up, she was holding a banana from her lunch, and deepthroats that thing, and winks at me. I was so mortified, I just looked away and pretended not to see anything, but they thought it was the funniest thing ever.\n\nThis was all in two days of substitute teaching, and it's getting to me. I've never experienced this kind of constant sexual harassment, and I'm wondering if I'm cut out for this. Any advice from more experienced teachers on how to deal with this would be appreciated.",

At first, I wasn\u2019t doing well in her subject (in fact, I even failed our final exam for math) but I decided to work harder, and I\u2019ve been getting such good results in her tests lately. She acknowledged them last week and she told me that she was looking forward to seeing my results for the final exam this term. She then asked me what my secret was to improving my scores so much, and I told her it was because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her.  She was so shocked by my answer and said she felt lonely because I might\u2019ve been pressured. I told her I wasn\u2019t and that I actually found her class fun. She started caressing my hair and my back and it made me so emotional. \n\nI think that, as someone who grew up with a mother who was always unpredictable and eventually became a person that I just feared, it felt amazing to have a person in my life that gave me the comfort and reassurance a mother should be able to give her daughter. In the span of less than a year, I\u2019ve started seeing her as the mother figure I\u2019ve always yearned for. Her presence alone makes me calm and put together, and it\u2019s such a refreshing feeling after growing up with a dysfunctional family. \n\nI\u2019ve even had multiple dreams about her already. Not weird ones ofcourse, all of them are just reassuring ones. One example would be her handing out our final exam and her asking me if I was ready. I said yes and she reassured me that I would be able to do it. \n\nDuring the night my own mother called me selfish and worthless, I thought of her tiny words of affirmation during our tests and how she saw that I really was trying. Sometimes I wish that she would adopt me (I had a really big obsession with the movie Matilda, so I am still stupidly hoping for a Miss Honey to come save me even though that will never happen). She\u2019s the only person that makes me feel safe and reassured. Has anyone ever felt this way? It feels so lonely and I\u2019m tired of crying about it every night.\n\nSo I guess I just want to say thank you to the teachers that really do care. You really do make an impact.",

Just to keep things as anonymous as possible, I'm only using gender neutral terms here when I refer to my students.   \n\n\nTo begin with, I'm not a naturally engaging person in front of a group or crowd. The default setting of my personality is quite mellow if not a bit dull and monotonous, and coupled with the amount of first year fatigue I'm feeling, it's EXTRA uncomfortable to act enthusiastic.\n\nAlso, I've spent much of the year disciplining several different students in this class to try and get them to control their behavior, and it's had mixed results even with just that. Even though this class has historically been one of my less responsive ones, I felt like I had a much more positive relationship with them towards the beginning of the year before some of them started testing me with behavior issues. I'm beginning to think I've squashed the spirit of the class through getting upset and punishing students.  \n\n\nPresently, I feel like I've completely burned the bridge with them several times over. They're not engaged, most of them don't seem happy to see me or have me there, and I'd hate to have to spend the rest of the year like this. I feel like I'm the most boring, undesirable teacher on the planet during that period. I've begun to resign myself to the fact that it might just be a terrible class the rest of the year, but I'm hoping that doesn't have to be the case, both for my sake and theirs.  \n\n\nWhat are some ways to reverse this at this point in the year? I know it may not totally go back to the way it was, but I'm honestly terrified of the direction things are headed. Anything I can do here?",

Another teacher (50?M) - technically an LTS for a colleague who is on medical leave - made a joke to/about me last week that I found grossly inappropriate. I'm being purposely vague here - but basically he said I left a sex toy at his house. (Needless to say, I've never had a sexual relationship with this person, been to his house, or encouraged this type of attention from him.)\n\nThis remark was made in the hallway during passing time, and there were students present. I reported to my union rep and my supervisor the same day, and today I contacted HR to file a formal grievance for sexual harassment/ hostile work environment. \n\nThis is not the first time this person has made a \"joke\" to me that I've found offensive/ sexist, and not the first time I've reported. On 2 other occasions this year I reported offensive / sexist comments to his mentor teacher, who is also my union rep, and to my supervisor. He even approached me and apologized after one of these earlier incidents. \n\nI know for a fact that I'm not the only person who has complained about this person's behavior being inappropriate. While I know I can't mention that in my complaint, I feel pretty sure that between what I've reported and what other documentation my supervisor has collected, there's enough to demonstrate a pattern of inappropriate behavior -- and I want action taken, which is why I'm filing. \n\nI'm hoping to hear from others who have filed this kind of complaint against another teacher. I've read all our district policies, but they are vague in terms of what kind of consequence he could face if/ when my complaint is found valid. I've already communicated to him, via my union rep, that I no longer want any interaction with him, and so far he has stayed away from me. However, because this behavior persists despite his being admonished by multiple people, I am hoping for a formal disciplinary response from HR/ district admin. \n\nHas anyone ever been through something like this? What happened to the harasser? And finally, any advice for me on making it through this process?",

I work at an after school art program that holds kids to incredibly high standards (this is beyond my control), and if they do not meet these standards, it reflects poorly on my performance. If the students work doesn\u2019t look as perfect as possible, I\u2019m often told to tell them to redo it. Lot of stress.\n\nI have a student who does not follow a single instruction correctly. Not. A. single. Step. Every second of the way, I\u2019m telling him to erase something because he went beyond instructions, or plain didn\u2019t listen. He is a good hearted kid, but so clearly struggling with adhd. He is more distracted than on task. He even distracts the other students.\n\nThis class, my students were completing a project with a particular messy medium, and when I turned my head I saw he had gone completely beyond my instruction to the point the project was not salvageable. He would have to restart  a with 20 minutes left of class. \n\nI had other students who do follow task\u2014 who were actively engaging, and felt it was best to focus on their instruction, as they had been trying so hard. I didn\u2019t think it would be right to take the class time to focus on the student who had been \u201cmisbehaving\u201d (not sure what other word to use\u2014 again, he seems to clearly need intervention for adhd) the entire time. \n\nSo, I had the student do an easier version of the assignment. My other students did aesthetically pleasing projects they were happy with. However, I\u2019m concerned my supervisor as well as my students parent because \u2026 his project honestly was not good at all. He scribbled it, and this is an expensive class.\n\nDo any more experienced teachers have any advice on how to handle this kind of situation? I can\u2019t make this student pay attention. I also can\u2019t give my good students the experience they deserve while spending 1/3 of class redirecting the one who disrupts class.",

It caught me off guard big time.\n\nWhen we were nearing the final work week, he came up and admitted that he hadn\u2019t started our project which was about 12 days long. \n\nHe\u2019d been doing well. I felt for him. He\u2019d been having meltdowns where he asked to go to the counselor. I spoke to two other teachers who had had him\u2014same issues. I contacted counseling, emailed home, and made a plan for him to finish the project over the break due to him mental state.\n\nQuarter 3 started nice enough. Then, as we neared the last two weeks of our paper, I see he isn\u2019t turning anything in. I catch it early. I make a plan.

Instead of reading the research that pertains to his topic, he annotates and reads all 40 pages. When I tell him his topic is too broad and he\u2019s using way too many citations, he argues that he needs to cite all ideas. Some of these ideas and common knowledge! He can\u2019t distinguish between what is important and what isn\u2019t important. When talking to him, he sighs loudly, shows me other assignments from other classes he finds similar, picks apart the assignment, and gets mad when other students have questions.\n\nWhat is most upsetting is that he is deflecting. He says he can\u2019t concentrate even though he wears noise canceling headphones all day. He\u2019s trying to make this about his classmates, but the classmates are working on an entirely different unit.\nWe\u2019re peer editing and it involves talking!

I can't deal with the lack of discipline and structure in the schools. I might be a little too quick to say this as I have only taught three years, but students are just plain disrespectful. \n Story time: I had already told my janitor yesterday , who I am kinda friends with, about my decision. She was telling me she would miss over the summer, and one of my students apparently overhead. He started a rumor that I was fired which is far from the truth. One of my eighth graders was happy to tell me later the day, and I caught the kid talking about. Now, I don't care what a kid says, I just shrugged it off. \nToday I go to the women's bathroom near my room before last hour, since the teachers is all the way to the other side of the building and I have classes all day after my planning period first hour,  and see on one of the stall walls Fire and then my last name. I first was a tiny bit mad, but then I was happy they could actually spell. I honestly don't even know what to think anymore. I took a picture and sent it to the principal and reported it. I'm keeping the picture as evidence to leave the school and having good reason to. \nI believe students have a voice and that's great; however, my fellow teachers thought was it plain disrespectful, and I'm inclined to agree. What do you guys think? How would you react to these acts?",

        "body": "I am a first year teacher and work at a small school twice a week as the ELL teacher (I pull students out to work in a small group) and fine arts teacher. Today, the whole school went into the gym to watch a play (presented by a company outside of the school). A classroom teacher asked if I could supervise her grade 4/5 class during the play for her because she had a lot to catch up on (she is also a first year teacher). I agreed because I was supposed to work with some of her students during this time anyways and I had nothing else to do other than be at the play. 40 minutes into the play, two students needed to go use the washroom. I let them go and they came back in an appropriate amount of time. Another 10 minutes pass and two more students ask to use the washroom and I let them go. A minute after, another student who has ADHD (who is usually disruptive in the classroom, sat so well for the duration of the play and needed NO reminders) asked if he could go to the washroom. Because the other two students were not back yet, I asked if he could wait until the other students came back. However, he said that he really needed to go so I let him go and he came back at an appropriate amount of time. Right when that student leaves to use the washroom, a seasoned teacher who has been at the school for over 20 years, turns back and mouths to me in an aggressive manner \u201cdo not let them go again. 3 is too many. They are old enough to hold it in.\u201d I felt so embarrassed because all the grade 7s I work with and the class I was supervising saw her aggressively mouth those words to me. 5 minutes later, the play ends and she comes up to the class and tells them that they are next time, they do not need to go the washroom because they are old enough to hold it in. That made me so angry because I don\u2019t like telling kids no when they ask to use the washroom. Likewise, I don\u2019t know these students personally enough to say no to the washroom (like what if a student has medical issues and needs the washroom?). Was I in the wrong for letting that many students go to the washroom during a play? Because it was mainly my class I was supervising that needed to go. The way the other rancher addressed it just makes me feel like I was in the wrong and I feel bad. Should I approach this issue with the seasoned teacher?",

Only then do the students listen. And when they listen, it makes such a great impact on them especially because they are at such a young age.\n\nTheir minds are still molding and growing and so they are open to learning and knowing new things but it demands their attention to be earned I think. When I was in school I hardly had few teachers who had mastery, ability to teach, and a fun way to put things. But I very fondly remember what they had taught me and, as a result, today, my career choice has a significant influence from them. When I read this quote from Sadhguru, it really did occur to me that these few teachers were the only ones whom I'd listened to and had a really wonderful impact on me. \n\nTeachers indeed have the privilege to empower children.

I have one student in particular, a 5 year old boy, and he\u2019s very violent. Firstly, I come to each students house with their parent their. His mom is around most of the session but he hits her too. He has hit me in the face and slapped my arm each session (only three so far). I told his mom today that I would give her the money back for the remaining lessons this week because he\u2019s too violent. He\u2019s only 5 but he\u2019s very strong and even tried to stab me with a pencil. She convinced me to give him one more try tomorrow but part of me just wants to send her money back through zelle or PayPal but she paid cash and I don\u2019t have her information so I have to go back to refund her even if I wanted to and I feel so bad once I\u2019m there in person. I\u2019m also 20 weeks pregnant so it\u2019s not just about my safety. Today when he hit me in the face, he started maniacally. I told him that it\u2019s not funny and to stop laughing and he kept laughing until his mom came back and then he started kicking her and slapping her. She won\u2019t discipline him but I just feel so bad stopping and giving up. What should I do? I also only charge $15 USD an hour because I\u2019m not tutoring for a big profit but because I enjoy helping kids learn and I wanted to escape the broken American school system. \n\nTLDR: my 5 year old student hits me while I\u2019m tutoring him and shows no remorse, should I give him another chance?",

        "body": "As mentioned in the title - I have several students in my 1st grade class who keep trying to stab their classmates with pencils. Sometimes it's a \"joke\", but typically it's when one child is irritated with another. The reason for their irritation could be because the child stood too close to them, answered a question that they wanted to answer, or (this is my favorite) because the other student looked at them funny.\n\nI have managed to intervene before several situations escalated to the point where long-term damage could occur (such as to the eye/face), but I cannot be everywhere/watch everyone all of the time.\n\nThere are about 6 usual suspects who do not care about conventional consequences such as Class Dojo points lost, messages home, conversations with parents at daily pickup, lost recess, writing an apology/taking responsibility letter, etc.. \n\n(A quick aside: I don't sharpen classroom pencils much anymore because those needle sharp tips are just too enticing. Everyone has to use their pencils until they cannot possibly write another thing, then I only sharpen pencils enough that they can be used for writing. Yet even dull pencils have proven to be irresistible weapons.)\n\nA part of me wants to take away the pencils from this group of students and have them only use crayons until they are able to demonstrate more self-control. (How will they demonstrate it? I don't know - maybe by not trying to hurt their classmates in any way for several weeks? Or by raising their hands to speak before blurting? Or by following directions the first time? Truly, I have the most outrageous, fantastical expectations for these children.) \n\nHowever, knowing this group of students, even if they don't have pencils of their own, they'll happily grab pencils from their classmates/my desk/other classrooms, then keep them tucked away in their sleeves/pants pockets until the time for stabbing is ripe. \n\nIt feels wrong to penalize the non-stabbing students by taking away their writing utensils, but knowing the behaviors of my usual suspects, it feels naive to think that they won't find other ways to continue hurting other children.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be wonderful.",

This has led to the kids telling on him for things- that, he isn\u2019t doing- I think this happens because it elicits a response and reaction from the teacher. \nToday, he was called up, humiliated and berated by his teacher- in front of the class- and I sat and struggled . I\u2019m disappointed with myself for not stopping and removing him from the situation, while his head hung, and the class booed him. I\u2019ve gone to admin consistently and I\u2019m only told, don\u2019t worry, this teacher is retiring this year. \nHow can I better advocate for the wrongs I see?",

That I'm more of a scheduling clerk than a counselor. The training we receive in graduate school is so out of the loop compared to what we will realistically encounter. \n\nMost of my time is eaten up with all my other job duties like course registration coordinator, testing coordinator, and  504 coordinator. It's a struggle with our roles being so blurred and not clearly defined\n\nI get a lot of requests that students need to learn social skills. I love small groups, but It's been such a battle to get one to run decently. I've had many groups dissolve. Students don't want to attend after school or during their lunch, admin don't want me to pull students out of class, I also don't have a place to consistently hold them. \n\nI want to align myself more with the ASCA standards, but I don't have buy in . I feel like my tires are spinning at this point, not much of what I do is actually helpful. My colleagues keep telling me to act my wage. I think they have fought the same battle and lost.. \n\n  I'm thinking of leaving the field, but I have sunk so much into this career path that I feel like I'm continuing just from stubbornness alone. \n\nSorry for the rant. I have long been a lurker of this community.  I appreciate all you educators fighting the good fight. Know that your counselors are also in the trenches with you.",

He lost it. He got in face, screaming at me. Then destroyed my class as well. My other students were terrified, hiding behind me as I tried to call for support.

Sent anything I was going to say to the guidance counselor running the meeting and they thanked me. However, another teacher on my team seems to have a problem with me skipping the meeting and said if she was in my position she would work through the day to make sure I was there for the parent and the kid.

I\u2019m definitely not business-minded (I teach elementary art) but I can manage a budget and do simple math. \n\nAny tips?? I\u2019m slightly nervous I\u2019m in over my head. And maybe paranoid about managing all the money lol. \n\nThanks!!",

Over the year I\u2019ve learned\u20262 kids have been sexually assaulted by their father, 2 have had their fathers kill themselves\u2026 one in the past, one a few weeks ago. One had her father die in 2020, and her sister die from leukemia that went undiagnosed during that period. Another had his father die of a heroin overdose\u2026 another had their mom leave and never look back last year.  Another had a sibling hang themself last year\u2026And these are just the things I\u2019m aware of\u2026 in a class of 21.  Northeast US\u2026 half affluent half low income population in an idyllic community. Most of the kids who I am discussing come from the more affluent side. I know we worry deeply about the kids\u2026 as I do about all of my students\u2026 but wtf is going on with adults. Same school,so many issues with the teachers and counselors. Just venting I guess.",

        "body": "I\u2019ve never seen an ass-whopping this bad. It wasn\u2019t a fight so much as a massacre. But little punk (let\u2019s call him Josh) is a constant problem. Always being disrespectful towards teachers and is constantly targeting minority/ LGBTQ students. His mom has reported me for \u201ctargeting her son\u201d but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Basically; this kid is like a real life Eric Cartmen with the mom a total enabler and it\u2019s never her son. \n\nNow the other student who administered said ass-whopping is such a sweet kid. He\u2019s been held back once or twice, but always so respectful. Well his mom has brain cancer and is undergoing treatment, and it\u2019s obviously affecting this kid. He always requests to go see the school counselor (and I happily let him go).\n\nThe student with the sick mom is black, and he became a \u201ctarget\u201d for josh. It was in the cafeteria, and josh starts talking smack to the other kid. Before I can intervene and in the blink of an eye, Josh is on the ground and big kid right on top WAILING into him. \n\nIt was bad. So here I am blowing my whistle and yelling at him to stop. I eventually get the other kid off and Josh is a mess;\u201d: broken nose, blood streaming out and he\u2019s crying. Well big kid still wanted to give him more and there I was trying to push him back, but he\u2019s crying as well shouting, \u201cdon\u2019t you DARE say that shit about my momma, n*gga!!\u201d The SROs come and I offer to lead the other kid (the one that did the beating)away. I put my arm around him and all the while he\u2019s still crying, talking about his mom. I take him to the principal\u2019s office and that was that. Don\u2019t know what happened, but part of me feels it was justified. Josh really was a little shit. Sorry not sorry if that makes me a bad teacher.",

        "body": "Hi folks!\n\nSo, this is my first time (I think) asking for this kind of specific feedback. I've certainly sought opinions and ideas before, but this time I'm trying to understand the legal requirements of IEPs.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I had a meeting with a SPED coordinator about a student (I teach HS ELA). The meeting was to determine whether or not I've been following the IEP. I went into the meeting confident, as I had (to the best of my understanding). Without giving away too much, it was a pretty normal IEP, with accommodations like:\n\n* Allow +50% time for essays and tests\n* Preferential seating at the front of the room\n* Graphic organizers for long writing tasks\n* Break down assignments into smaller chunks or manageable tasks\n* \\-15% to 50% work reduction based on complexity and student need\n\nSo, I went in. I was asked how I was meeting each standard. My response was:\n\n* I give extra time to all students for tests and essays, based on demonstrated need. This student, by having an accommodation plan, has clearly a demonstrated need\n* I have made the first row available, but this student (senior, 18) has opted not to sit there\n* I give graphic organizers to everyone\n* ***ALL*** of my longer assignments are broken into chunks, simply as a way I teach students to approach them\n* (This last one was the only on I was concerned about): I try to avoid any \"busy work\" of any kind. I provide a text to read. I give short quizzes on basic information (more or less so that the student can demonstrate that the reading got done), we do a test and a project. That's it. There are discussion days, mini-lessons on writing, that sort of thing, but as far as course content, it's read the book, talk about the book, write about the book.\n\nNow, I won't get into everything (I have probably already driven away most people), but I was told this:\n\n# Any scaffolding or modification you provide to the whole class automatically means that it doesn't meet the IEP.\n\nIs this right? The SPED person actually at one point threatened me with legal consequences, but obviously wasn't actually quoting laws.\n\nSo, my SPED friends, is that what you tell your colleagues? What are the rules? If I'm wrong, please help me understand this better. If my SPED colleague is wrong, please provide me with jargon and clarity that will help me state my case more clearly.\n\nThank you all. Sorry about the brick of text.",

I am very friendly with my kids and normally allow them to have recess early and their grades and significantly improved since I started. The last teacher quit because she got pregnant. I started playing soccer with the boys at recess and sitting with my students at their lunch tables. Today my dean of students told me that other teachers made complaints about me doing these things. For recess they were mad because I was apparently doing duty, however my duty is only on two days and I only play when I don\u2019t have duty. I wasn\u2019t to bothered by this and this morning again my Dean of students told me that I got another complaint. My dean of students got a complaint because I was sitting at the lunch table. They said it was creepy because I was sitting with 3 girls and a boy who doesn\u2019t have friends. Unfortunately I fear that because I am a man I am being targeted and given a negative connotation. I was very annoyed because one of the 4th grade teachers sits with her kids all the time. She is a female teacher, so when I brought up the fact that I think it\u2019s because I am a man, my dean tried to avoid that path. She told me to stop eating with them and just sit in my classroom alone and eat. I am just so upset because these complaints come from teachers who don\u2019t know the whole story. I sit with one of the girls because she is my cousin, one of the boys because he has no friends, another girl because her father left her to go to Vegas. I truly just want to be a good role model for the rest of the year they have left. What should I do?",

It\u2019s still a tough job though and I get so much joy seeing my students learn math. I RARELY have my kids say \u201cwhen am I ever going to use this in my life\u201d and on the one occasion a kid has done this (to my face) I had multiple other students step in and although it wasn\u2019t the most serious answer they still stepped up to defend math which I hope is a good sign that I\u2019m helping them not hate it going into high school. I absolutely love the students we get at this school I love saying good morning to them in the hallways and knowing their names and stories about them. We also do a lot as a staff because our kids do have more difficult home lives and we try and make school more than just \u201cjail\u201d by having a Thanksgiving Meal as an entire school that staff cooks for the kids, we do a secret Santa where we buy kids gifts, etc. So I find my job and career choice very fulfilling and rewarding. \n\nSo when I think about kids I know personally I would get a lot out of it too because I enjoy kids of all levels I teach and have tutored 6-18 year olds. But I\u2019m scared that one of those aspects of my life would take a hit: teaching or being a mom. I\u2019m also scared that I will miss out on the joy that does come with motherhood. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m in a unique position than other fencesitters because I know my career choice is very fulfilling and I do enjoy going home after work getting to unwind and relax without having to worry about having to take care of anyone else.",

Well, I went to admin about it and he talked to the former student teacher about why it \n\nlooks bad to be messaging 11 and 12 year old girls. Tech also looked through the school email and the correspondence was nothing inappropriate so nothing came of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday while I was helping a student I saw a notification come up on her Ipad from him. She quickly tried to hide it, but I saw it was from him. Which means he is still messaging these girls. When he has no business doing so. I have no idea where to go from here because no one seems to care or thinks it's weird that even though he was asked to stop he is still messaging these girls. Maybe I am going crazy. Maybe collectively we don\u2019t think it's strange for an adult man who isn't a student\u2019s teacher anymore to still be in contact with them continually after being asked to stop. Maybe I am the strange one for caring.",

It\u2019s not a great paying job but teachers know this going into it and there are not that many other jobs where you get the summer off so I mean\u2026\n\nSecond, are all schools this way???

They will, however, continue to have a full conversation right in front of me talking shit about the parents, the kids, other teachers.  I don\u2019t mean a little crap talking, I\u2019m talking absolutely dogging kids who are obviously poor or abused, saying how dumb kids are who clearly need help, talking shit about how other teachers do things and their personal lives.  \n\nThird, what in the hell are some of them so damn mean for?  The above grade I have to sub in gets yelled at constantly.  Yelled at about the bathroom, about making any noise, about looking at somebody next to them, about asking a question.  They\u2019ve been honestly pretty good for me and I have yet to yell at them.  I get I\u2019m a sub but I don\u2019t believe yelling at kids all day is going to get you results.  It\u2019s school, not prison.  To top this, a kid got absolutely blasted by a kickball the other day and knocked the wind out of him to the point he was laying on the ground wheezing and they were yelling at him to get up and get over it.\n\nI did want to become an art teacher but hell if all schools are this way maybe I don\u2019t.

My school has classes that last anywhere from 1 Hr and 30 minutes to 2 full ass hours. It's manifested in kids giving themselves 15-30 minute bathroom breaks  every class. Kids checking out and falling a sleep.

        "body": "I teach 7th grade social studies. In my district, most elementary feeders are K-6, which means 7th is the first year in middle school, and the first year with honors classes vs. general ed classes. Because we are the first middle grade they attend, the honors students are selected by the 6th grade teachers. Technically speaking, I don't have an honors class for SS, but all the ELA and Math honors classes happen at the same time. So they have to all have SS and Science at the same time too. There are like 5 general ed kids mixed in. \n\nAnd they are my worst class. Everytime. Because what the 6th grade teachers do is pick the quiet kids. The kids who follow the rules and don't get in trouble. The kids who finish their work. While this is an important component, it can not keep being the only thing they look at. Because the kids I get in honors class can't think. They have spent 6 years learning how to get the \"right answer\" and be in line with the classroom. When I ask them opinions, they have none. When I ask them to empathize with historical situations, they can't. Analysis? Only if I hold their hands to the answer. They won't even try if they don't know. Juxtaposed with my non honors classes, it is a glaring difference. \n\nToday's example: we are discussing the differences in countries' solutions to the economic downturn of the 1930s (basically discussing FDRs solution to vank runs v Hitlers solution to inflation). My general ed kids picked up immediately from the fireside chats and speeches that while both men were given more power to solve the crisis, they used that power differently.  My honors kids: blank faces. Answers like \"Both men became president.\" or \"Both took control of the country.\" \n\n Nothing changed about my lesson. Like I said, it's only honors because of scheduling restrictions. And I think that is one of the problems. We all know elementary schools dont teach social studies, or only if they have time, and its through ELA. So, while these kiddos are great in math and reading, they have never been asked to problem solve or think for answers outside of the box. And they suck at it. They just know how to find the right answer. We have to stop valuing students for quiet and really start assessing their potential for growth. Anyway. Downvote me if you want. But it's the vent I had inside me today.",

When they brought this up, a principal honestly said, \"Get over it.\"  I wouldn't blame those teachers for leaving the district at the end of the year.\n\nSecond, they had to do a simulation.  The first time they had to hide in a classroom with nowhere to hide and get shot with darts by local police.  My wife was in a computer lab.  How many places are there to hide?  The second round allowed them to fight back.  They were warned not to actually harm the police as earlier sessions had done so.\n\nThird, the police officers were more understanding than the administration.  They apologized beforehand and told the teachers that they didn't have to do it.  The administrators didn't care.\n\nI think my wife put it best:  \"We aren't allowed to be human.  We can't have feelings or personal lives.  We have to be robots.  But not too robotic as that would be traumatic for the kids.\"\n\nThank you for reading and thank you for doing your best in a world that hates you.",

Senior-itis is frustrating (thought understandable).\n\nIf I change, I would be on familiar ground; I know the subject matter.

You might have a lot to learn, but you're already pretty amazing just the way you are.\n\nSo, cheers to a great school year, and here's to many more adventures to come. Stay sassy, my little first-grade rockstars.\n\nLove,\n\nYour Badass First Grade Teacher.",

        "body": "So I posted about this in the substitute teacher sub but I wanted more opinions about why this teacher did this. \n\nSo I subbed for an 8th grade Science class. The teacher gave them as assignment on their Chromebooks that involved reading an article and watching slides and answering questions. \n\nThis is a pretty good school so most of the kids were doing it while they chit chatted. No big deal. \n\nApparently a brand new seating chart was made so I had the kids stand in a line at the front of the room and I would get their name and then we would find where their new seat was and I directed them there one at a time. \n\nSo that took a good 10 minutes or so. Then I gave out the assignment and took roll. \n\nThe problem for me was where ever this teacher was she was watching the kids on the Chromebooks remotely the ENTIRE day. \n\nNot just checking in. The ENTIRE day. If a kid was on anything but that assignment even for a second she would pop up message them and scold them. \n\nOften times as a sub I will tell the kids if \nThey finish all their work and show me and they have no make up work, they can play an educational game. But she jumped on and gave a kid a demerit for doing that when I told him he could! \n\nBecause if a kid has nothing to do they are gonna harass other kids and start being disruptive. This generation of kids can\u2019t idly twiddle their thumbs in silence. So playing an educational game when your work is done is fine! \n\nAnother kid got yelled at for doing work for another class after their work was done. Another kid got yelled at for being on google to research an answer. \n\nShe actually messaged the entire class asking why it took so long to start working. Ummm maybe because we had to do a new seating chart?! \n\nI personally found the amount of micro managing going on unacceptable. \n\nIf you can be watching them all day- just come to school! I had it more than handled. Even the difficult class was being ok. \n\nWhy on earth would you take a day off to watch that all day?! Enjoy your day off! \n\nI will never sub for her again and I made sure to leave a note defending the kids that if they were on google or an educational game etc it\u2019s because I told them they could.",

        "body": "TW: mentions of bullying and suicidal thoughts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got this one student (11yo) that drives me nuts. He's got good days (they're rare, but they are there), so I know he's capable of behaving. He just doesn't want to 95% of the time. He's impolite, manipulative, vindictive, a liar, and racist. He talks back, is loud, can't stay on his seat, doesn't ask for permission to do anything, insults, can be agressive... He shows no respect towards his peers, teacher or material. He doesn't see anything wrong with everything he does. He'll always find an excuse even when he's clearly wrong. He tries to gaslight everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried:\n\n\\- Dialoguing with him and positive reinforcement.\n\n\\- Verbal warnings.\n\n\\- Ignoring him (only for him to become more and more disruptive until you can't ignore him anymore). He clearly acts like this to get the teacher's attention, and giving it to him is wrong, but not giving it to him is even worse because he bothers everyone in class :(\n\n\\- I've made him go out of the classroom and work on the tasks alone.\n\n\\- I've made him stay in the classroom instead of going to the playground.\n\n\\- I've written notes to his parents.\n\n\\- I've banned him from using his school laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing's worked so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't sent him to the principal, and I'm considering doing this as a next step, but I'm afraid it'll have the same effect: null. He doesn't care about anything. He doesn't care about his marks (he fails, obs), or about his parents knowing about his attitude. He doesn't care about any kind of reward or punishment. His attitude changes not.  It's my second year of teaching (which doesn't help). I've got lots to learn when it comes to classroom management. Is there anything you'd do if you were in my place? I'm running out of ideas. With other disruptive kids I've had, it may have taken some time, but I've seen progression. Many have improved to the point they don't disrupt my class anymore (a mere verbal warning is enough to stop and work this term, while I had to be more strict at the beginning of the school year). I'm the same teacher using the same methods I listed. I don't know why they don't work on this one kid in particular or if there's something I'm doing very wrong. What I know is he misbehaves in every single class with every teacher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a psychologist. He clearly needs one. A kid who's healthy and emotionally stable doesn't act like this. He claims he was bullied in another school to the point he was suicidal. The situation is delicate, but then again, he lies constantly. His past teachers say he wasn't a victim and, in fact, his attitude in my school is more similar to that of a bully than that of a bullying victim. Some kids are intimidated by him. I just see him and think next year, when he starts secondary education, he'll be suspended time after time. He'll retake years until he's old enough to be kicked out of the system, that is if he doesn't get involved in drugs or get in trouble first. It's a pity. I really want to help and I do my best, but it's discouraging. I'm losing faith in him, and I know this doesn't help the situation either. I think he's lost faith in himself too, tbh. So I'm asking for some advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nA desperate and fatigued teacher",

        "body": "Today I faced the most demanding challenge of my life, normally I don't usually care much if teachers yell at me or don't yell at me but this one stood out from the rest. My geography teacher let's call him Eric came into the class as usual, with a grumpy attitude and a turtle neck sweater. Our class asked him about his day (this was the last class of the day) and if he liked a local musician.  Eric over here the moment when he got to class started yelling at the students to get to their seats not caring about the questions. The kid thought he had not been heard so he repeated himself. Eric snapped saying how we were arrogant teenagers that didn't know anything and how we were always trying to distract him. After he complained about that for 10 minutes he said his lesson was all gone and there was no point in even starting (I'll tell you at that point he had another half hour of class left.). He complained for a whole 10 minutes about how we were bad students, and after he turned his attention to a student which we will call Jake. Jake at that point was very calm and listened to him for a good 7-8 minutes after answering. The teacher said he would let Jake answer but he didn't have to and that he didn't like abusing his power and that if he wanted he could if he wanted to crush all of us and make our classroom crash on our heads. At this point, I gave a little giggle at how funny that was, and classes ended.\n\nSo dear teachers of Reddit please explain to me why he may have acted this way, and why in general teachers like doing this because this is just one example.",

        "body": "I know this varies by school type and state, but I wonder at anyone's insight into this.\n\nI was offered a position as a music teacher at a private school in PA. 3 weeks after accepting the offer/going through clearance work I was asked for the credential. I had spoke with recruiter in my first interview and was wrongly told  that I could work towards it while employed and the school would even sponsor part of the costs. \n\nNow, they confirm they can't hire me without one, and that it would take 2-3 years for me to obtain one most likely if I my classes from college are only art/music/general ed.\n\nSo I'm going to try to ascertain the requirements for pvt/charter/public schools in NY/PA/NJ/CA. Wish my research luck, please!",

        "body": "Hi everyone, \n\nIm a first year teacher that started SECOND SEMESTER! I\u2019ve been working as a teacher for about 2 months now. No background experience and no license. I started working at a school that offered to help with me certification/license and such so I could teach two different subjects of math. \n\nOnboarding I was told I would have two prep periods and the students advisory time as a prep period as well. (Students go to their advisors classroom at the beginning of the day and the middle of the day for about 30 min) because I do not have an advisory I was given that time as also more prep time. \n\nThey decided about a week ago they wanted to give me an advisory. So that\u2019s one hour less of prep time. \n\nI have my 3rd &amp; 4th period as prep periods There\u2019s usually a meeting for each math  subject across each of the campuses through zoom once a week during my 4th period (these meetings usually go over next weeks lessons and some practicing).  So that takes away 2 prep periods each week. I was told about these prep period meetings during my onboarding and was told the rest of the 3 days my 4th prep period would be free. However, as of last week they added two more meetings during my 4th period prep with administration to go through future lessons (basically the same thing as the zoom meetings expect in person with admin). So now I\u2019m left with only 3rd period to prep and only once a week 4th prep period. \n\nShould I complain? I think this is so unfair. I need those prep periods. 55 min a day is NOT enough. What should I do? Should I advocate for myself?",

There have been so many moments where it just feels pointless and I try to focus on as many students as possible that want to learn, but in some periods it is next to impossible because of the constant need to redirect bad behavior.

        "body": "Hi all, I'm wondering what to do when middle schoolers or high schoolers make sexual jokes during class. I want to be sex positive, and it's alarming how frequently it is coming up. Everything from girls randomly yelling \"titties!\" in class to students referencing things like anal beads or blow jobs. It's obvious and awkward and then everyone starts laughing. It's wild that it's 10 and 11 year olds making these jokes and primarily them doing so.\n\nA male student today said \"I learned how to drive stick shift over the weekend\" to which I responded \"that's a great life skill to have\" and another student busted out laughing saying \"that doesn't mean what you think it means.\" I simply said \"hm and I don't think you're as subtle as you think you are.\" I'm a female and I feel like students, especially male students, make these jokes frequently when they wouldn't necessarily in front of male teachers. Whether that's because they want my attention or because of a lack of respect I'm unsure. \n\nAnother time an 11 year old female joked to her friend who was laughing and spit up soda \"you're supposed to be a good girl and swallow, no complaining about it.\" I couldn't believe my ears. How do I address not only the joke but also the fact that it is reinforcing potentially problematic narratives especially for females? Other jokes frequently are homophobic and problematic.\n\ntldr; how do I address sexual jokes made in front of the class in a firm but sex positive way? How might I address jokes that might be problematic (harmful for females or LGBTQIA\u00b1)?",

        "body": "Title\\^\\^\\^.\n\n I took over a 4th grade ELA/SS classroom on February 6th. The teacher left for a better-paying job at a well-known university close to us. I can't blame her! \n\nTaking over in the middle of the year will knock even an experienced teacher off of their feet (so I was told, no idea if this is truly the case lol.) I think I've been doing ok, especially since I've had endless personal issues that conveniently started only one week into my new position. I've held on anyway though. \n\nThe behaviors are horrible. I had NO IDEA that teachers dealt with this. I knew there were issues, of course, you can't deny everything you see and read about the teacher shortage (and the reasons for it.) This is different, however. The attitudes, the actions of the students...they are UNHINGED. Hitting each other. Grabbing each other inappropriately. Constant disruption. Tattling beyond what is considered typical for the age group. Not listening. AT ALL. The worst? THEY WILL NOT STOP TALKING. It doesn't matter what I do. What I say. What consequences there are. They WILL NOT STOP. The supreme, absolute WORSt of it all? THE BULLYING. I have already had to deal with a few instances of things that have just broken my heart and brought me to tears. \n\nTo make matters worse, it seems that ***actual discipline*** isn't something that happens in school anymore. I don't understand it. I am 38. When I was in school, you didn't dare cross your teacher. If you did, you paid for it. If it continued? You were sent elsewhere so you wouldn't disrupt the other students who were there to learn. How can we modify these behaviors when we can't discipline our students and stay consistent with consequences? I don't know the answer to that and it scares me.\n\nALL I DO is deal with behaviors all day long. Granted, it isn't from everyone, but it's a very specific group of students throughout the three blocks that can not compose themselves or make sound choices. There is also a student who clearly should not be in a general classroom. He has something happening that is beyond his control (TBI, Autism..something.) The amount of violent, hostile outbursts coupled with constant disruption and a few terrifying meltdowns prove he needs to be in a different setting. The parents won't complete the paperwork for evaluation and we're stuck. This is especially challenging for me because truthfully, I am not qualified or trained to handle issues like these. I'm just here to teach. I want to teach. \n\nI'm not sure what the answer is and I guess I'm just here to 'vent.' Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far.",

The test is reading passages and answering questions. Guess what we\u2019ve been doing for the past few weeks? Reading The Hate U Give and answering questions, along with various writing tasks and tasks that focus on specific things such as symbolism, character foils, etc. They don\u2019t see that as me teaching them in the way that they see other teachers teaching them new content. In ELA we mainly practice skills that they already have the foundation for. What can I say to help them understand that I\u2019m doing exactly what I\u2019m supposed to be doing and that I\u2019m different than other content areas??",

I\u2019ve moved students around, threatened office visits etc. but they always do the same stuff the next day. I noticed the recent uptick in kids playing chess, and I myself have been playing chess for the last 10 years. I\u2019m not super good (rating of 1100) but i knew I was far ahead of the kids in the class. I finally decided to say fuck it and I put my chess username on the projector and challenged the class to beat me. I beat 7 straight students while projecting the games for everyone. I got called a sweat a few times but now I think I\u2019ve earned their respect to the point where they may listen better.",

As a result of the overwhelming support I received from the community yesterday - and after hearing about the Lobby Day being held by AFT on Monday, March 13th - I decided to create a corresponding rally event for those who want to advocate for Texas teachers! \n\nIf you want to show support for HB 1548 and voice your advocacy for Texas teachers, I implore you to join us at the Capitol on Monday, March 13th at 1 PM. Let's show our representatives and school district leaders that the people want - and demand - a raise for our teachers.\n\nHere is the flyer I created for the event. If you could share this flyer - as well as this post - with anyone and everyone, that would be of IMMENSE help to spread the word on this rally. Teachers at my campus and the campuses of my friends are trying our hardest to raise awareness, but we definitely need y'all's help as well!\n\n[Rally for the Raise Flyer](https://ibb.co/VpCdTT6)\n\nAdditionally, here are some relevant links that provide insight into why we are rallying for this raise, as well as more information and ways to help -\n\n[Teacher Vacancy Task Force Final Report](https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/tvtf-final-report.pdf)\n\n[Announcement of HB 1548](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/politics/texas-legislature/teacher-pay-raise-texas/269-31d258ef-bf4b-48ae-9b11-56337069c787)\n\n[AISD Let's Talk - Share Support for a Raise](https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/DialogueCustom.aspx?k=WF4B4ZLT@MDLT@DY9R2F5LT@LDLT) \\- click \"community member\", select \"suggestion\"\n\n[Texas AFT Public Education Advocacy Day Event Page](https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/547628/)\n\n[AISD Compensation Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AkdoKz1finwQJ5e7TP4W8M-Ge25V7hAUCD37juF86b8/edit) \\- see page 18 for a look at current pay and raise schedule\n\n[Find Your Representative](https://house.texas.gov/members/find-your-representative/) \\- contact your representative and voice your support of HB 1548\n\nThank you for any support you are able to provide!",

        "body": "After essays on the last semester exam, I decided to start giving my high schoolers spelling tests.  I've been going off \"the 100 most misspelled words in the English Language\" and I feel it's been genuinely valuable--challenging for the kids but manageable. They express triumph when they get it right and so on.\n\nBut there's one girl, who is just dismally far behind.  She will get 0/10 words correct, even after four days of in-class review.  She doesn't have accomodations, and she does actually try--she showed me her notebook, where she'd written out the words ten times (something I don't require, since we sound out words by syllables and come up with tricks to remember the spelling.)\n\nThe end of the quarter's coming up.  Part of me feels that someone so far behind in spelling maybe shouldn't pass on (she also has trouble reading aloud, but again, she actually *tries,* as opposed to some of my yahoos), but another part is sympathetic to how hard she's tried and wants to offer her some alternative assignment, like a vocab sheet, that she can use to add on to the spelling test grades.\n\nThoughts on this then? Like I said, I thought of a vocab sheet, or a much longer \"fill-in-the-blank\" assessment.  If she's not getting the quizzes, then I'd like whatever extra credit she gets to also be work.",

One of the classes I teach is supposed to be dedicated to extra Language and Literacy and I am having problems structuring it effectively.\n\nI only have this class once a week for 50 minutes and it is with a 7th grade mixed English level class. Some of the students speak no English, a handful are at an intermediate level, and then a few are native English speakers. The levels are all over the place. \n\nI am trying to figure out a strategy to keep all of them engaged. I feel bad leaving my lower level students confused when we read a story and decode the vocabulary, and then I feel bad for my more fluent speakers that feel bored reading a fifth grade text. \n\nThey\u2019re a bit rowdy so I can\u2019t do just group/individual work for a long period of time. I would like to structure it starting off with some daily English speaking bellringer (like everyone answer the question of the day, with a structured chunk sentence if needed), the main lesson, and then possibly split into groups? I\u2019m not sure if I should mix the levels or have students work together in the same level and then give differentiated work?\n\nI think I am just looking for ideas, strategies, or someone\u2019s experience. I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m doing a bad job and I just want to be better. \n\nThanks in advance \ud83e\udd0d",

I am lucky.\n\nLast night, I was with my grandpa as he took his last breaths until about 3AM. I've gotten less than two hours of sleep, but my coping mechanism is to go to work and stay busy for now. Some may think this is wrong, but it is how I always have operated. Grandpa was my best friend and a father figure, so this one hurts.\n\nMy question is regarding school today. Is it appropriate to send an email to students and let them know about what happened? I would tell them in class, but keeping it together would be difficult. An email is direct, but it avoids the potential for emotions running wild.\n\nAny advice you have is appreciated.",

To be honest, I feel quite offended by that. Is this a common practice among schools when issues like this emerge? Am I too sensitive to feel offended? What would you do if you were in my shoes?",

But she just looks at them with a blank stare and walks away with them while they are continuing this kind of behavior.\ufffc I think that part right there is the part that makes me the most angry.\ufffc\ufffc\n\nI have some ideas about how to proceed forward but I just had to get this off my chest.\ufffc\n\n\ufffc\ufffc",

For a few years now I've wanted to pursue teaching, but I have some concerns and am really in need of some advice right now that I don't think I could get from people who aren't actually experienced with teaching.\n\nLike anyone, I'm concerned about the low pay of teaching jobs, as well as the potential to endure particularly harsh behavior from students and parents alike-- and because I live in the US, I have certain concerns over gun violence and safety, though this has not been an issue in my area in the past. \n\nThat said... I love teaching. God, do I love teaching. I firmly believe teaching is the best way to make a positive impact on kids lives, and I have such a passion for education. I had very, very poor experiences throughout my own schooling, and I want to be able to make a difference for those coming after me...\n\nBut how do I balance my passion with the very real anxieties of low pay, or the worries of our current real world situation? Especially as a queer trans man, I feel like there's just no space for me in the field; and every horror story from teachers I meet deepens the rift between my passion and ( what feels like ) my common sense. \n\nTo add to these worries, I'm not particularly well off currently, and to invest in the higher education necessary for me to begin a teaching career is high enough where the prospect of flunking out of it in a year or two makes me feel a bit sick. \n\nOverall -- I'm just in a bit of a decision making pickle, and a bit of input would be invaluable to me :^)  Thanks in advance !",

        "body": "Hi all. First year teacher here. One of my English teachers from my high school is retiring and he and a handful of other teachers there reached out to me about applying for his position. I decided to just because it would be too good of an opportunity to pass up. \nHe also runs the theatre department, and that was the main draw for me. I have a ton of theatre experience, including in this specific program (I was an officer on the drama club board and heavily involved in every show) and was very excited for this possibility, as it would be combining my two biggest passions. They were interviewing 5 candidates for 2 English jobs, one of who would also be responsible for the theatre stuff. I would be shocked if one of the 4 other candidates were even interested in taking on the theatre duties, let alone if any of them were as passionate or experienced as I am. \nThe teacher himself recommended me for his position and I thought the interview with the principals went well. I hadn\u2019t mentioned to anyone at my current school that I was applying for this or even that I was looking at leaving. \nToday, I got an email from my current principal telling me that the principal at this other school called him this morning inquiring about me. My current principal asked if I was planning on going there next year because if I was, he would cancel our formal evaluation/end of year progress meeting. \nI was honestly shocked because I didn\u2019t think they would call my current school without discussing it with me first! On the application, when it asked if they could contact my current employer, I said no because I would like the opportunity to tell my principals myself if it gets to that point. \nI thought the fact that they called must mean they were planning on offering it to me, and even though I was a little annoyed that they didn\u2019t let me tell my bosses myself that I was planning on leaving, I was seeing it as a good sign. \nHowever, after school today, they called and said they decided to go with another applicant. Okay. Normally I would just be disappointed, but now I\u2019m mad. They totally screwed me over. Now my school knows I have a foot out the door and they didn\u2019t even get to hear it from me. \nI\u2019m also concerned that maybe they WERE planning on offering it to me but my current principal must have said something negative about me that made them change their minds, which freaks me out. \nNow I\u2019m worried that (a) they will not renew my contract and/or (b) that whatever positions I apply for in the future they will give me a negative recommendation as well and (c) that I will face retaliation from my current admin without even having another position secured. I\u2019m also just very frustrated that this school contacted my current school when I requested that they don\u2019t. \n\nDo you have any advice? Am I right in saying that the other school was wrong for contacting them without letting me know first and then not even offering it to me? Should I talk to either schools\u2019 principals about this situation or just let it go? Does anyone have similar experiences and how did you handle it?",

Unfortunately, my school is losing a kindergarten position next year and since I'm the low woman on the seniority list, that means my job is going away. School admin likes me and offered me a job in first grade instead. I don't think it would be hard to find another kindergarten position in my district. That said, maybe I would enjoy first grade. I am looking for feedback from experienced elementary teachers--how different is is teaching first grade compared to kindergarten? Thank you in advance for your thoughts!\n\n(As a side note, my partner has a good income and our expenses are pretty low, so I have some flexibility to wait for the right fit.)",

        "title": "Tired out.",
        "body": "Usually, I actually like teaching. Kids joke around with me and have fun most of the time. I have few discipline issues. I like my content. Lately, though, it's like the kids just do not give a fuck. I looked up from grading for 3 minutes today during a film to see half the class on their phones, 3-4 more others sleeping, and about 4 conversations. This is a *film analysis class.* WTF do I do at this point? Just blanket ban all phones? Start yelling? I'm so tired of wishing the kids would just get HALFWAY on board with learning some stuff. So much of what we look at is legitimately fascinating, but so many of these kids do not agree and do not care. I used to do song and dance routines to make them interested, but it's too damn tiring trying to find a way to \"gamify\" everything or make it fun. A bunch of these kids are going to fail because they'd rather look at a phone then watch the films they signed up to watch in an elective class. Oh yeah, and some of 'em won't graduate because of it. \n\nLately, I ask a question and even the kids who used to engage just stare blankly at me. I don't know if Gen Z is so consumed with anxiety that nobody will ever speak again in public or what, but it's so frustrating playing to a \"dead\" crowd every day. I have to bend over backwards to get even the slightest hint of engagement, but at the same time it's on me to call parents when a kid fails... even though parents have ready access to kids' grades online (which mine never had back in the day--they waited until conferences to find out or read my report card). \n\nIt seems like we're just deciding kids have zero responsibility in the classroom. If we want them to learn, even as 17-18 year olds, we have to be nannies. Take their phones, pace the room, FORCE them to pay attention to a movie and FORCE them to engage. Sit down next to them and FORCE them to open their assignment up and get off their chromebook flash games. FORCE them to pass. I can't do that for even 5 or 6 kids in a class of 30. There isn't time in the day. Nevermind that it's absolutely soulsucking, because the teachers I always looked up to were the fun teachers, not the disciplinarians, and I used to have fun at work. I can feel how in another 3-5 years I'll just have to be a grisly ass disciplinarian like so many others who pounces on anyone who takes a step out of line, because if I give these kids an ounce of freedom, they use it do do nothing at all. \n\nSome of my classes are still... classes. They still feel like a learning environment. But every year, more of them turn into this bizarre rec hall vibe where I give an assignment and watch as 70% of kids just choose to do whatever the hell they want to do rather than even trying. Every year, I have to spend more time redirecting young adults to do things like *read a paragraph.* It is exhausting me and making me demoralized. \n\nJust needed to vent. Maybe some of you disciplinarian types can give me some pointers, because my natural bent towards being laidback and collaborative is no longer working. It used to work well. I got excellent results and had the data to back it up. Nowadays, if I try to make the class into a team to work at learning together, the response is for everyone to remain on the bench and laugh.",

It's n***** this, n****** that (he is black). Acting thuggish. He went up to my ESL kid and got into his face accusing the kid that he called him a n******. The ESL kid had no idea and kept apologizing.\n\nThis kid goes to one of the best schools in Texas. His dad is a teacher and has done everything to put the kids in a good position. He's GT and has every opportunity to be an immensely successful person. We were talking today with some down time. I was asking students their plans after graduating. Typical stuff for this level of students. Med school, law school, CS degrees, Pharmaceutical Rep, etc. Not this kid, I'm gonna be a millionaire. How are you going to do this? Nah, I can't say. Y'all some narcs in here. No one in here cares, what's the plan? Pushin. Oh ok. \n\nSo you've got this kid who has his entire potential in front of him. Everything looks great but what does he want to do? He wants to get rich by illegal means. \n\nSo when he goes and does his illegal business. When he eventually has to pay the price for his decisions, was it our fault? Was it his school? Was it the system? Or was it the choices he made to be apart of a culture he aspires to?",

I've noticed he behaves slightly better for teachers who appear to be in a good mood, so I try to act like I like him, even when it seems likr he's trying to make himself as hard to like as possible. \n\nThis morning, Leon was not at school on time. He eventually arrived while I was teaching the whole-group reading lesson. I didn't see him walk in because I was busy when he arrived, but as soon as I noticed that he was there, I walked over and said, \"Leon! You're here! I'm so glad you were able to make it!\"\n\nY'all, this kid *smiled* at me. Directly at me. A genuine smile, with his whole face.

Okay now onto the main part of the story, a woman walks in telling us to finish that practice test and that she\u2019ll be back at the end of the period to collect it to be graded and leaves us with practically a baby sitter. Well the end of the class rolls on by and no teacher in sight to collect so almost all students but two take it home assuming to give it in next period. (The other two through it on her desk not knowing what to do.) So the next day we come to class to tell her and she gives every student a Z in the grade book (a Z is worth 40 Fs in the way she graded it.) As stubborn as she is she listens to no students even the ones who left it on the desk and fails everyone and insist she will not fix the grade. It took my grade from a 76% to a 64% so from passing to failing in just that one assignment. Do you think it\u2019s fair?",

This made another student in the class who happened to be mixed race very upset, and they came up to me during the lesson to tell me what the offending student had said.\n\nI was appalled and didn't know how to respond, this offending kid usually never said this kind of stuff so I told him that wasn't nice to say and to stop. If he said something like that again I would send him to the principal.\n\nFor context, I'm just a student teacher not the actual \"head teacher\" of the classroom, so I think the kid was probably testing me a bit to see if I would punish him for saying something like that.\n\nCan anyone give me advice for when kids say stuff like this? I was so lost on how to handle it for a minute tbh",

        "body": "*I know, I know.* I picked a **really** bad time to come to such a realisation, considering the fact that my school was on strike just last week\u2026and last month. But that aside, it\u2019s just something I really wanna do, and a door I definitely don\u2019t want to close on myself in the future because of my actions now. I\u2019d like to think I have a lot of respect for teachers, as well as a clear vision of what I can bring to the table, and \u201ccreating my own unique lesson plans for random topics I find interesting\u201d is one of my brain\u2019s go-to activities whenever daydreaming sets in. I know, it\u2019s silly, but it\u2019s kind of one of my dream jobs in a way.\n\nThe main issue I have with the prospect of teaching though is just all of the touchy safeguarding stuff that comes with working with under 18s. Obviously it goes without saying that I have no intentions of even looking a student in the eye once I leave school, let alone doing anything inappropriate, but the idea that my *whole entire life* must be PG, because *god forbid a student accidentally gets a slightest glimpse of a teacher doing adult things*, is ridiculous to me.\n\nSo like, how serious are the rules, really? The main thing I need to worry about *right now* is my digital footprint, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m worrying too much or if I actually need to sanitise everything effective immediately and never sign up to anything again.\n\nSo, for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s an overview of my current digital footprint. I\u2019d really appreciate some insight from y\u2019all who are actually working in the field right now - would this be acceptable for a typical teacher or not, and what bits in particular are problematic? Thanks!\n\n1. To start, I\u2019d like to make it abundantly clear that I don\u2019t consider this Reddit account part of my overall online presence. I have never said anything that would link me to any real person, or to my other accounts. I might\u2019ve said some cringey shit wayy back in the past on here. However, at some point soon I intend to delete this account (but not before editing my comments into gibberish so that they\u2019re actually lost forever)\n\n2. My \u201creal\u201d social media presence is only on Twitter and Tumblr.\n\n3. My first name and middle name are public on these accounts, but not my last name.\n\n4. So far, I have never shown my face, and don\u2019t intend to anytime soon\n\n5. I post my art on those accounts, anyone who knows me fairly well irl may recognise me from said art, and if they did I wouldn\u2019t deny it. If those accounts ever gain a substantial following, I may use them on a semi-professional level for freelance art in the distant future.\n\n6. I refrain from swearing, but have probably slipped up once or twice\n\n7. I\u2019m very open about my political views, which can be summed up as \u201cLate stage capitalism is a disgrace. Billionaires should not exist. Voting isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t all get along - religion and lgbt are compatible, women only benefit from trans liberation, immigration should be easy, etc. We must all unite against the common enemy - the Nazis, terfs, and xenophobes that lie to us to create rifts.\u201d. By some definitions I\u2019m \u201cproblematically\u201d far left, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m at least a bit more of a sappy \u201cLoVE iS tHe AnSwER\u201d kid than my Molotov-lobbing contemporaries.\n\n8. I have an AO3 account linked to my other socials, where I write a pretty ok Splatoon fanfic. I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty PG minus a few swear words. I don\u2019t know how well that reflects on a background check if it\u2019s kept visible. I mean, yay for decent-quality creative writing in unexpected forms\u2026?\n\n9. If I was a teacher, I would never tell any of my students my socials, or follow them or anything like that. Maybe if I was in a creative writing-related lesson and the situation called for it I\u2019d mention my Splatoon fic in passing, as a \u201cWhat I was getting up to when I was your age\u201d-type thing, to encourage different types of creative writing practice at home, and to make people laugh, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThat\u2019s everything I can think of that could possibly be \u201cobjectionable\u201d about my online footprint as of writing. So, yeah, any thoughts? Am I worrying too much, when most other folks my age are posting unhinged shit with their real identities front and center, or should I sanitise it all and be on absolute lockdown?\n\nAlso, I feel like it\u2019s worth mentioning that the other part of me wants to have a career in singing. I\u2019m really not sure how far that\u2019ll go, whether I\u2019ll end relegated to local gigs, or I\u2019ll be a modest indie success, or the next queen of pop. But, if I ended up doing teaching and singing at the same time, what would be the expectation in that scenario? Would I have to keep that an absolute secret from my students, or could I be more open about it, as a nice \u201cfun fact about me\u201d? If I was open about my side hustle, would associating my social medias with my band cause any issues, since it\u2019d be indirectly sharing my socials? Would I lose my job if I released anything objectionable, like performing an explicit and/or overtly political song at a gig, or including one on an album?\n\nI know these may seem like kinda silly questions, but they\u2019re the main issues that bother me about the prospect of teaching, second only to shit salary, and I couldn\u2019t find any clear cut answers on Google, so I figured it was best to just pour all of my concerns into a Reddit post and unleash it on the people who actually have experience with, y\u2019know, teacher life. Any insight whatsoever would be much, much appreciated! Thanks for reading :)\n\nTl;dr: hypothetically speaking, if I grow up to be a substitute teacher, would a fairly unfiltered semi-hidden sfw art tumblr/Twitter, and a (presumably) small-scale singing career on the side with possibly political or explicit lyrics be considered inappropriate?\n\nPs: if you\u2019re wondering why I specify \u201csubstitute teaching\u201d, it\u2019s because I can\u2019t commit to 1 subject I\u2019d wanna teach, and I\u2019m bad with names so being in different classrooms all the time sounds nice, and I\u2019m willing to possibly take less money home if it means doing less admin work that isn\u2019t the actual teaching. Admin work is my weakness, and I want free time.",

I have scoured the handbook and can\u2019t find anything about a fine for quitting.

They can\u2019t make me keep coming past my resignation date, replacement or not.\n\nI feel super guilty about leaving, and am filled with anxiety about how my administration will react and treat me.

Our only veteran teacher is at her wits end everyone else is newer than me at teaching!\n\nI'd be grateful for any veteran teachers who have seen disciplinary actions that actually work to share what that action was. So far we have just added lunch detention (a para volunteered and is getting extra pay for it) and have had phone calls and referrals (but our admin is in referral parent meetings practically all day). \n\nAs a note, most of the problem behaviors are pretty minor, disrespect and disruption of class. Bullying and violence is what gets pushed up to the admin and she is fully willing to give students suspension. \n\n(Sadly in CA expulsion is basically a pipe dream although for an extra violent kid admin is trying to make it happen although the kids parents are trying to sue the school over it \ud83d\ude43).\n\nSo what discipline have you seen be effective?",

I haven\u2019t heard anything and I\u2019m wondering what my next step is? An official email? Does it go to my principal or my superintendent? Help!",

        "body": "Today in class, Johnny (9th grade) refused to do anything, like he has every day this semester (I teach 1 semester courses). I've spoken to Johnny's mom once back in January. Back then, we referred him to the school social workers and tried to help her get some social assistance.\n\nBut today, not only did he refused to do anything but play games on his phone, he also CALLED A FRIEND to play this Call of Duty style phone game OUT LOUD during the lesson, disrupting everyone. And when I tried to have a rational conversation about how he was not just harming himself now, but also everyone around him, he was a jerk. \"Call admin, do it! I want them to suspend me! Leave me the fuck alone!\"\n\nSo I decide I will call mom again this afternoon. Then, I find out he's not living with mom anymore, so I call dad, and had a totally unique conversation I've never had before in my 5 years teaching. \n\nDad's words can be summarized as \"I fucked up. I know why you're calling me, and I'm sorry that I have no answers. I'm doing everything I can, but I've learned recently that grounding him only makes it worse because he tried to run away from home. This is my fault. I spoiled him. I created this mess and now we all have to deal with it. Let me know if you find anything that works. We are getting him into counseling but he might just have to learn the hard way like I did when I was his age. Sorry.\"\n\nI've never had a parent come out and own their mistakes like that. Heck, I don't know if I've heard that kind of honesty from most teachers, either. It was shocking!",

I generally feel foolish and inept; teaching in 8th grade special education leaves me with a student population that is not likely to do well.\n\n I was observed (unannounced) a week ago. The students were reviewing basic scientific notation, and playing a board game while we reviewed to keep them engaged.  The principal watched as they worked to ADD THE DICE.  They worked well on our curriculum-based, eighth grade level topic.  They kept practicing and accepting feedback until they got each problem right.  I was proud of them!  But adding the number cubes, then adding again to calculate where they'd land on the board, was an ongoing mini-lesson- and they cannot add fluently.\n\nThe observation was scored well, but I feel like the bigger win was the students' display of their limitations to admin.  I wish I wasn't required to park them in front of the unmodified state test each year- it would be so much more valuable to measure progress instead of just telling them they still aren't at grade level.  But perhaps one more admin seeing where they are starting will set a path for more realistic expectations, and celebrations of *progress* instead of just *passing*.\n\nTyping it out, it looks less like a win.  I know there's no meaningful change coming.  But hopefully, you guys get what I mean and feel with this one!",

No details yet, but young and unexpected. We're respecting the family's need for privacy and trying not to pry. I worked with her for almost ten years.\n\nLife doesn't stop. It's our competition season. Two of my class periods today were covered by a sub so I could take one of my students to a speech competition...where the student did wonderfully but was disqualified for going over time (them are the breaks, judge even emailed us about it to encourage her to come back next year--we will, and she'll crush it).\n\nThat's not the problem. Live and learn and work on timing.\n\nOne of the two periods, my sub just...didn't show up. The fun of period coverage, right?  Don't blame the coworker at all. Communication crap happens with this sub shortage, so it's not even that surprising. Frustrating, yes. Unprofessional, yes. But, fortunately, finding a sub isn't my problem.\n\nThis is a senior Honors English course. There are worse ones to go without a sub. Especially because they knew what they should be doing.\n\nOne of them went to tell a teacher they didn't have a sub and asked another English teacher what to do about that (props to my colleague for coming in to sit with them). One of them took the answer key for the grammar quiz we were supposed to go over today (I keep them in a routine place). They threw it up on the smart board.\n\nThe kids discussed the answers and graded their papers, stacked them nicely on my desk, and then sat in a circle and discussed *Beowulf*. I arrived at the end of the period, and they had gotten just as far as I would have with them. My colleague was sitting there with them and verified everything. \n\nI almost happy cried.  That was my light today, my 7th period, who sometimes wonders why I just don't care when they're goofy.  On the days where getting through most periods feels like a war (I have five preps, one I teach twice, and a study hall), I needed that.  \n\nHope you all find your glimmering moments this week.",

It feels like there's a mutual connection between us and maybe even a little bit of chemistry. I don't want to jump into anything too serious immediately, but I've considered asking her out.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been in this position. Is this ethical? I'm a teacher. She's a custodian, so there's not much of a power dynamic. We've talked enough that I don't believe she currently has a boyfriend.

        "body": "This is my 19th year of teaching and my 14th year as a middle school teacher. I have taught at the same school for the past 14 years and the complete lack of empathy these kids have is astounding. One of my students in my 8th grade class is battling an eating disorder and today was her first day back from the hospital in two months and four of the boys in the class kept referring to her as Dry Bones (the character from Mario) and singing the song \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie\u201d around her. She was wearing leggings and her hip bones were protruding through the fabric.\n\nI sent all four of them to the main office and kept my student after class to check on her (she was okay and said she wasn\u2019t going to let them affect her) but I am so tired of telling my students to be respectful of their peers. Maybe I sound old but this generation of kids have zero knowledge of respect. This isn\u2019t a one time occurrence either. Last week one of my students was involved in an incident where one of her ribs was broken and her deskmate poked it to see if it hurt then got mad at her for flinching. The rise of the Andrew Tate influencer is driving all the staff members crazy. Students will interrupt the class to make a joke referencing Tate or talk about the \u201csigma\u201d mindset he preaches. Because I teach history everything I mention is \u201cfake news\u201d or untrue. Often times a student says it in a Donald Trump accent and I have to stop a political discussion from breaking out among the students.\n\nThankfully I am one of the more respected teachers in the school but I am tired of teaching middle schoolers. My contract ends at the end of the year and there is a spot opening up at a nearby high school and I think I will apply for it. I taught high school for the first five years and I honestly miss it. It will be United States history which I am more confident about covering. I need a change and this might be the best option for me. I still love this profession and see myself doing it for another 15 years but I need a change of scenery.",

She said she didn\u2019t hear me intervening and wouldn\u2019t even let me give any context. The worst part is that she was more concerned of the optics and the video being leaked to the media. There was no concern that I\u2019m burned out (which I have expressed), that I have no disciplinary support to suppress the behavior, or anything about support in general. Just how it made her look and how \u201cbad\u201d it would be if the media saw it. \n\nLike most of us here, I\u2019m hamstrung by restorative practices and incessant reminders to call parents. In fact, that was her on suggestion\u2014to call the kids\u2019 parents. I walked away at that point. I wasn\u2019t having any more of that. I could have probably done more to de-escalate the scuffle, but it never got past shoving and I calmly instructed the aggressor to leave and they did. What more am I supposed to do? I\u2019m so sick of ineffectual administrators. Part of me wishes the parent would leak the video so the world can see the truth.",

The locker is technically assigned to student B- with student A\u2019s locker being somewhere else in the school. \n\nLocker in question is directly outside my classroom and does not have a working lock on it (Student B\u2019s request). During my prep today, student B, counselor, and other teacher were talking around the locker. Student B walks off and then the counselor and teacher bring backpack into my room and search it. (So as to not be in the hallway).\n\nI think nothing of it-thinking that was student B\u2019s backpack and they gave permission for it to be searched. Later after school teacher tells me that they were actually searching student A\u2019s backpack because student B told them that student A sells weeds at school.\n\nI do believe that there may be some truth to student A selling weed at school. \n\nBut student A has no idea they searched her backpack and I feel uneasy about it. Is this allowed?",

        "body": "Back again! Sorry in advance if the post is a bit confusing\n\nI've been asking my teachers what they did to become a teacher because I'm not getting super clear answers on how to go about it.\n\nMost of the teachers I've asked said they got degree for other things first and a certificate for teaching (eg. Doctorate in Math, Masters Communication, Masters History). I also asked my counselors (once a few years ago and once last year).\n\n I plan on taking Psychology in college but also an Education degree. Is that the wrong choice?\n\nAm I better off getting two majors that aren't Education (like Psychology + English) and getting a teaching certification afterward? Does it make a difference if I get an Education degree instead? \n\nMisc Info: I am interested in teaching highschool or being a counselor. And there are other options I am hoping to teach Special Education and Elementary Education. So I really can't tell what option makes the most sense for this.\n\nSo far I've taken Early Childhood Education as a career opportunities class last semester.\n\nI also plan on furthering my education after the initial college years, maybe for a Masters in Psych or take something else like language classes. Not for having more in my tool belt, even though I'm sure it would help should I choose to teach something else.\n\nIf anything, I might take Psychology and Early Childhood Education. And then work my way up to high school since I know teachers that have done that before. \n\n(I'm graduating HS in May so I'm looking for solid answers!)\n\nAny advice is appreciated :)",

I don't have a regular teacher contract, but I am supposed to get paid through the summer (because it is money that I am earning during the year).

They want 10$. Which isn\u2019t that much but it sticks in my craw that they\u2019re even asking us with how underpaid we are. So last year I didn\u2019t donate. \n\nThe director of development emailed me all last year asking me to donate, texted me so much I just blocked the number. I just didn\u2019t respond. He made a sarcastic comment to me at pre planning that really irked me. Something like \u201coh I\u2019m sorry if I *bothered* you trying to better the school.\u201d\n\nThis year since I\u2019m out of fucks to give I responded with a simple \u201cI am unable to donate.\u201d And this asshole just sends back this:\n\n&gt; hi [teacher],\n&gt; Thanks so much for following up. I would love to sit down together one day this week for 5-10 minutes to talk about this further and answer any questions you might have.\n \n&gt;Faculty support makes a big impact when we ask foundations for 7-figure gifts, and I really want us to hit 100% faculty participation this year after being at 99% last year. Just know that your $10 gift could help us get a million dollar gift from a foundation.\n \n&gt;Let me know a good day to come by your classroom to discuss.\n\nI\u2019m going to just respond \u201cI don\u2019t have any questions or free planning time. I will not be donating, and it is illegal for a workplace to coerce their employees to donate.\u201d \n\nBut I\u2019m so MAD. How dare they bully teachers who are barely making ends meet to donate to a school that just raised 40 MILLION for a new building?? Could I pay 10$ and be done with it, sure.

Instead of receiving med and taking a break, I will be reviewing content that I did not go to college for but it\u2019s \u2018so necessary\u2019 I\u2019m here for that. \n\nRage doesn\u2019t cover what I\u2019m feeling right now.",

If anyone attempts to take it away from her, I, as her father, ***WILL*** be suing for theft and assault. This is non-negotiable.\u201d \n\nShe was passing the letter around to various teachers - after I read it, she said \u201cI\u2019m gonna need that back to show to my other teachers.\u201d\n\nI know she said that her cursive handwriting and her dad\u2019s cursive handwriting look *identical* (that\u2019s how she got away with having him do her homework) but this wasn\u2019t even written in cursive, and it doesn\u2019t look like her print handwriting. I think her dad actually wrote this. \n\nI don\u2019t take phones away anyway, I just warn people that I won\u2019t be explaining it again since they chose to mess around. District-wide policy is that they\u2019re allowed but teachers have the discretion to take them away if used inappropriately. \n\nI just told her \u201cummm okay\u201d after reading the letter. I\u2019m a parent and I don\u2019t act like my permission overrides school policy (my 11, 15 and 17 year old kids\u2019 schools have the same policy as mine and are in the same district. If they get their phone taken at school then I\u2019d take it at home, but they\u2019ve never had it taken anyway.) What should I do about this letter?",

My kids have been testing since January and test twice as much as regular students since they have to take state Spanish tests. \n\nThey sprung science fair on us a month ago (kids have been testing etc) and my assistant principal just told me it\u2019s mandatory for my kids to do science fair even though they don\u2019t have time.\n\nI\u2019ve been staying up till past 1am grading, lesson planning, anchor chart making, participating in school events, attending meetings and creating lesson plans for units my kids didn\u2019t grasp. \n\nI don\u2019t have it in me to make my kids participate and half ass science fair and turn it in the third day after coming back after spring break. \n\nMy kids struggle to even write. Some don\u2019t fully comprehend English and they get anxious. \n\n\nI honestly want to quit so bad. One, because they\u2019re pushing these kids too far. Two, because I\u2019m severely underpaid and putting my heart into something that can\u2019t even fully pay my bills. \n\nIs it wrong to push this on them and listen or should I say no?\n\nI love my kids so much but I fully comprehend why there is a teacher shortage. I\u2019m not certified to teach which is why I get paid just over $100 daily yet here I am with a degree and my kids have learned so much and progressed so much. \n\nThe sense of reward is there but that doesn\u2019t pay bills nor do I feel like I ever get a break. *It\u2019s ridiculous and beyond depressing. Not to mention I spent over half my daily pay on a couple groceries yesterday, I genuinely feel I can\u2019t afford to eat.*\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you for listening and please share your thoughts",

        "body": "Hi All, \nMy district had a violent incident on one of our high school campuses last week that resulted in a student fatality. This has left all of us reeling, myself included. There is supposed to be a community \u201clistening\u201d event this week for people talk about their concerns, share ideas, etc. Obviously, safety concerns have come up a lot, ie what can we do to make our campuses safer, so I\u2019ve been thinking about it all weekend, and I just don\u2019t have any answers.\n\nEveryone involved in the incident was a student\u2014no one was on campus that wasn\u2019t supposed to be. It happened in a classroom, during a class, so not an area what would have been patrolled by anyone, so I don\u2019t think having SROs back on campus would have made any difference. And the vast majority of our students are POC, so I also understand why having police presence on campus is not something that would actually make us feel better. Our admin asked us to keep doors locked during class for 2 days following the incident \u201cto help students feel more safe,\u201d but I just had to answer the door every time someone pulled on it, and there are no windows or peepholes in the door. My students thought it was stupid. I actually ended up feeling more unsafe. \n\nI grew up in a major city on the east coast, so my schools were always single buildings with single entrances and both my middle and high schools had metal detectors. Is that the answer? The schools here are not set up like that. Campuses are mostly outdoor with classrooms having direct access. Making these changes to limit access to campus and installing metal detectors would be ridiculously expensive, and considering that the school district has already been bulking at the cost of just installing a fence at my school, it seems unlikely. Plus, the idea of making schools feel like prisons does not entirely appeal to me, and I can\u2019t imagine it would make students more likely to come to school. \n\nI know concerns about school safety are not limited to my district, so I\u2019m curious what others have been thinking about. What are some things we can do to make our schools safer places for students and staff alike?",

        "body": "Hey all, I am in the process of getting hired by a school as a full time teacher. I have been working at this school as a substitute since February of 2022, essentially I\u2019ve been here a whole year. In that time I\u2019ve done everything from just being a floating sub to holding long term sub positions while I wrapped up my teaching certification. My question is what are the chances the school honors my year as a substitute there when it comes to pay and steps. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is if I\u2019ll be able to start out at step 2 since I\u2019ve been at this building for a year as opposed to step 1. Is this something a school would even consider?",

I mentioned that May is both Asian American heritage month and Jewish American Heritage Month. One of my students responded by saying \"fuck the jews\". My students KNOW that I'm jewish, I've always been open to them asking me questions about jewish culture. I was a little shocked, but one of my students immediately stood up and said \"You can't say that! People used to kill jews for real! They still do!\". The student that defended me is one of the best friends of the student who made that comment, and for those of you who don't have an 8th grader in your life, standing up to your best friend for saying something shitty is HUGE. \n\nI wrote the girl up, but I made admin call home. I don't think I would've been able to keep my cool if the parent tried to argue with me about the referral. Apparently the mom was mortified that her student said that, but the student denies saying anything at all. The student was supposed to get a consequence, but that hasn't happened yet. According to the handbook, she should have been suspended for up to 10 days. We have benchmarks this week so I doubt it'll get handled this week either. I'm just so angry and upset over this, it's like my admin is telling me it's okay for my students to say they hate jews and I'm just supposed to take it. If this isn't handled and admin sweeps it under the rug, I'm quitting.",

If you\u2019re out sick, there\u2019s not much you can do about getting a sub last minute. \n\nSo I got this email this morning from our principal:\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\n\nWe have had several days where car rider teachers are late or out and did not get someone to fill in for them. This can not happen. This is a safety and liability issue. If a student gets injured the school district and you  can be sued.\n\nPlease make sure you all communicate with others so this does not occur anymore.\u201d\n\n\nSo I call bullshit. Maybe the school district can be sued. But how can I be sued if I\u2019m not there? This boils down to lack of leadership, honestly \u2014 they know who is out each day, and they know what the car duty schedule is. Admin should figure out coverage. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s threatened this. Last time was when people were out and they didn\u2019t have 2nd load coverage. Admin never realized there was no coverage until a good 30 minutes in and kids were running all over the cafeteria because no staff was down there. Again \u2014 you know early in the morning who\u2019s out, and you have access to the coverage schedule. I guess you should follow up and make sure someone gets down there, even if it\u2019s admin covering. \n\nThis is complete nonsense.",

My parents know I'm interested in art but they seem to be very against me doing that as a career.\n\nIf I pass this year ill have a BA hons. I do know a lot about art from self study and I draw and paint for 2 hours each day. I should also be getting some experience this summer teaching art. \n\nwhat else would I need to do qualifications wise? I also probably need to keep this a secret form my parents ( :  \n\nAny advice on teaching art would be very useful for my summer job. \n\nthanks!",

I'm tired of the same old routines, the same old drama, the same old, same old. \n\nI want to branch out and try something new but every time I do, I am typecasted again as the \"upper elementary teacher\". I've asked my previous admins from previous schools to give me different grades but they wouldn't have any of that, which sucked! They just kept convincing me to take the upper elementary and when I wouldn't have that, they didn't budge either and kept me there. \n\nWhat should I do? I would really like to ask my admin to change me. Already I have a group who wants me to stay in the upper elementary side but I don't want to anymore. I just want to work with the lower elementary students (kindergarten to grade 3, preferably grade 1 to 2).",

My coworkers are nice and supportive of me, some of the students get excited to see me as well. I feel like I'm really part of the staff inside of a ghost who merely floats about the building. \n\nThe only thing I truly dread honestly is working with the older kids, ironically enough the 3-5 students. When I work with the younger kids, I find classroom management to be easier for me to handle and get them to sit quietly and listen. When it's the older kids my mind blanks out and I just feel incredibly stupid. I have no clue of how to get them to listen, focus on the work, and it makes me feel incredibly inadequate. It's the only grade levels that I dread subbing in. Anyone have any advice/suggestions for what to do about this?",

When I was getting my degree I was dealing with some health problems that were only diagnosed and treated properly after I had already graduated, so I ended with a 2.86. Unfortunately, the classes I got the worst grades (including an F, and passed with a D+ when I retook it) in at the time are now the subject I want to teach (math). At the time I was just trying to get through the degree with everything else going on, and I wasn\u2019t planning to become a teacher. After several years working, I decided to go back to school and do a teaching program to change careers. I\u2019ve gotten a 4.0 in my program and I want to teach the subject at the middle school level, which is completely different content than college level math. Does anyone think my old grades will hinder me with getting a job in the subject area I\u2019d like? Any advice?",

Then, after 2 weeks, ANOTHER report to CPS was made against me for something else ridiculous.  CPS didn't pick up either, the whole thing was a non-issue with them. I was being completely targeted. I spent 20 years in another district without a single whisper of impropriety. Now, 5 months into this new position, I've had 2 in one month.  The first one resulted in a write up (even though nothing was investigated by CPS), and I just took it. The second one resulted in me being put on administrative leave and a meeting with HR (even though, again, CPS balked at the referral). Due to the stress, I ended up going from an admin leave (where my doc prescribed heavy duty anti-anxiety drugs and a sleep agent), to actually getting sick. SO - I've been out of work for 2 weeks. Keep in mind after 20 years, I've NEVER had my professional integrity questioned. EVER. Until this school.\n\nThe gossip around my school is vicious. And the principal is generally the ringleader. I've already been warned by the only person I trust at the school that it's going around that I was on admin leave for the entire 2 weeks for an \"investigation\", which is totally untrue (but that makes for boring watercooler talk). And because write-ups are strictly at the discretion of the principal, I'd imagine the second one will be a write-up as well. \n\nAnd yes, I'm going on interviews to get out of this dumpster fire of a school. \n\nTLDR: Being targeted for unknown reasons, been out for 2 weeks, and the gossip about why I was out will be a huge topic - likely focusing on my absences after 2 reports were made.",

I teach first year Spanish and heritage Spanish, and I learned the hard way when I had to miss have a day to attend a training a few weeks ago, that no matter how certain I am that the kids know what they are supposed to be doing, and however carefully I write a sub plan to let the sub know that the kids know what they're supposed to do... there's a 90+% percent chance that whatever sub comes in will take one look at it, say \"it's Spanish, I don't know Spanish,\" and let them fuck around for the whole period and not get anything done.\n\nI've even gathered together a whole collection of emergency sub-plan activities, but it doesn't even feel worth it to do anything but tell the sub that \"today is a work day, tell them to work,\" because they won't even do that.\n\nAnd I DO know how hard it isn't to be a sub.  I was a floating sub, and was so great at it, they hired me on as a building sub, and then when the Spanish teacher quit mid-year, they told me \"guess what, you're a Spanish teacher, now...\"\n\nI know that a good sub could get them to do things.  I know if I dropped off copies of worksheets (our subs can't make copies) and left very, very clear instructions, that if I hit the lottery and got a good sub, that maybe 40% of the students would do what they were supposed to.  But it doesn't even seem worth it to put in that much effort and roll the dice, knowing it's almost certain that nothing will happen.\n\nSo, do I take care of myself and do what I need to do to stay healthy and sane? Do I spend an hour or two trying to make a solid sub plan and almost certainly find on Tuesday that it didn't happen? Or do I just grit my teeth force myself to drag through another day, and hope I'll get a magical dispensation of extra time and energy and will to live somehow if i go i tomorrow feeling as shitty and exhausted and burned out as I feel right now?\n\nGod, this job is so hard.

I don't like having any control over the pacing and what is taught in the classroom, nor do I like making minimum wage for performing an extremely emotionally draining job. Tech salaries make me pissed off even more. I'm thinking this might be remedied by becoming a teacher, it will be my own classroom, I'll make more money, etc. I don't know though.

I have two behavior students who are engaging in a physical fight most of the time. There were instances where I had to put myself in between the students to try and de-escalate the situation. The worst was when the student (who's bigger than me) pushed me so he could attack the other student. I am not CPI trained, nor do I want to be (I'm afraid of the holds, I'm physically small compared to my students). The admin tried their best to help me by reaching out to the SPED department but to no avail. They are still in my classroom.\n2. The SPED department is adding another student to my class. The new student will come from a behavior school and has an emotionally disturbed (ED) eligibility.\n3. Some of my students are saying a lot of sexual innuendos that make me uncomfortable (e.g., jerking motions, saying they will impregnate their peers, etc.). I feel sexually harassed and have been reporting to the admin. They have suspended some students a couple of times, but after a few weeks of days, they will do something else to make me feel uncomfortable (twerk in front of the class while I am having a lesson, etc.). \n\nI'm seriously stressing out and having panic attacks every morning on my way to work. I reached out to my union to see what they can do to help me, but they have not responded back to my email.",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nFirst post here to Reddit looking for someone wiser with experience. \n\nIm in my 5th year high school Math teacher and now my 3rd school I\u2019ve worked in (Rural, Urban, and now a suburb, which is my alama mater)\n\nI have just recently found out on Friday they are not going to renew me for hire next school year, which means I will not get the tenure I was hoping for. I\u2019m pretty shot, I had all my marbles in on this job, I\u2019ve done my 3rd year of an Instructional coaching cycle (voluntarily) focusing on class management and enhancing instruction.  All submitted under the Danielson Domain 1/4 evidence, but that was not enough. I\u2019ll be honest I have one class that\u2019s very obnoxious that makes it difficult for everyone else to focus. It was so tough that one student complained to admin about wanting to switch classes, I got a talking to in the admin office from the students affidavit, then it continued so once she got mom involved, they switched her classes naturally, which didn\u2019t help my case to show any improvement. I have been continuing to improve my classroom management skills, especially when I compare myself to my 1st year teaching job, plus the prior year where the coach saw a much bigger change in growth.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was, the principal did an informal 10 minute observation of my lesson in an Honors class, I was teaching a complex problem that I didn\u2019t have completed in my notes, and I thought the students would be able to come to the solution. (It was graphing multi-step rotations) \nThe principal was pretty upset that I wasn\u2019t able to solve the problem, although she admitted I remained calm under pressure, i let the students work through the problem (which they were able to, we just didn\u2019t come to a con census on the correct answer.\n\nNow, I\u2019m at a loss of what to do. I have 65 some PD hours to renew my license, as it is my 5th year of teaching and it expires June 2023 (graduated may 2018)\n\nAny advice on where to go? I feel somewhat hopeless when my formal observation reviews were all related proficient and excellent, no insufficient or unsatisfactory, no concerns for class management.\n\nMy union president\u2019s advice is to resign by a certain date so I \u201cbeat them to the punch\u201d instead of them going through the process of not renewing me through the school board, I can let them know Much faster by saying \u201cthank you for the opportunity, but I will be resigning at the end of the 22-23 school year etc.\u201d\n\nWhere do I go from here? Ann Yost been in a similar situation?",

        "body": "Been a long time since I read my college textbooks on special education, and to be honest, despite getting an A in the class I BS'ed the class so I wouldn't know... Should this particular type of student I'm going to describe even be in a gen ed classroom? He's a 4th grader who can't read or write and maybe he never will because of a severe \"processing\" issue, he is a sweetheart and follows directions calmly but he has big problems paying attention, he can't take out his stuff and get ready without his shoulder partner or I helping him, and he needs extensive 1 on 1 interaction constantly for him to have a chance at doing anything without it simply being the shoulder partner or the adult doing like 90 percent of the thinking, reading, and writing for him.\n\nI'm left alone in my room most of the time with little push in help from the sped team and little help from my part time teacher assistant. I have two dozen students in my class, many of them with IEP's and even those who don't can be pretty abysmal if I'm not in my calculating android/drill sergeant mode. Takes a lot from me to set up everything so that the class can be good enough when I'm in small groups with the kids who can do fck all if I'm not holding their hand, and even when working with them it can be tough to go from one kid to the next in our small group. Each kid in the group may be fidgeting with their pencil and zoning out into a different dimension if im not with them at that moment, and I also have to be observing the rest of the class like a hawk, making sure they're being productive.\n\nIn this kind of environment, which I believe is the fucked up norm in this country, I can't optimize or specialize my support for this 4th grade kid who can barely do anything. I feel like I'd need to assess him more and have a masters at the least in special education to feel like I'm not simply neglecting him. He's mostly just been a passenger all school year long and most of the only work he ever does comes at the end of each trimester when either myself or an adult sit with him and do most of everything for him.\n\nAside from the specific question itself this has been a rant, yes, but it's also a question about how badly organized and funded our school systems are. I don't think classrooms in general should have more than 15 or so students, and they should probably be differentiated so students of certain levels are paired with each other perhaps. And kids like this student I've mentioned can't be in packed gen ed classrooms with little support.\n\nAnd there's also the problem that the school doesn't really have a curriculum, it's crap and most teachers just have to make it up themselves, and I don't have the time or even the know how unfortunately to necessarily teach them the reading skills that they should have learned from K-3. I do end up feeling like a fraud who should be teaching middle school to get farther away from being held accountable for students not being able to read.\n\nI teach 4th grade and my school has even made it a point that we shouldn't try to focus on catching students up on past skills so much as rather we should be trying to make it accessible for them to come to contact with the current grade standards but that's a problematic and complex proposition, especially because if these kids can't read it's a problem, a problem I don't have much time or resources to alleviate. \n\nWhat a fucking disaster. This kid, as sweet as he is and as much as I love him, should probably be learning in a different context imo. Might tell his mom this in our next parent conference.",

Wtf am I supposed to function on so little sleep? \nAnd you know what? I deserve all these things TOGETHER! Not just pick one out of three. \n\nHow is some stupid 3 point goal or lesson plans done in some exact format that doesn't help me teach or the extra class that they have us teach now instead of home room or the new stupid version of PLC that now takes up my planning more important than my basic health?\n\nPeople whose jobs are to be in constant battle mode need to distress and try to plug holes in their broken bodies and psyches. The only calmer parts of the job are still intensive AND they are to be done on my own personal time! When am I supposed to calm down from that kid yelling that he is going to bring his gun and shoot me or that kid throwing pencils at everybody and all the constant paper poppers? \n\nAnd for what? To be in debt? \n\nThe scary part is that I'm considered to be doing just fine. Except for all the stuff that I need to change since they hired a new instructional coach. She docked me several points on my surprise evaluation last Wednesday for not having my 3 point goal displayed. It WAS displayed. It took up half the wall- absolutely gigantic. And I'm more pissed than is reasonable because those fucking things are written in my blood. Each and every thing that I have to do after school (after cleaning up the classroom that the students trash because most of our janitors quit when the kids assault them) is at the expense of my basic physical needs. \n\nIt's okay. They just announced that things will get better because they've decided to hire a behavioral coach. Not for the kids, but for the teachers. Can't wait! I hope that coach person thingy starts by demonstrating how to get the kids to stop throwing food at the cafeteria staff for sport. Who am I kidding? It's gonna be more useless crap for us to do on top of handling everything on our own. \nI think I'm gonna move on at the end of the year.",

My daughter has a lip tie that we\u2019ve been trying to deal with since Jan. Her apt is the same day as the state dept visit so I\u2019ll have to miss work that day. I feel so guilty about having to miss work but we\u2019ve waited months for my daughters apt so I also don\u2019t want to reschedule. My principal was very understanding but I can tell it stressed her out. She said she hopes we can get a sub. She sent an email the next day saying all staff are expected to be there. I don\u2019t want to put anyone in a place by missing but the apt is important. Just wanted to get that off my chest.",

        "body": "Gave an AP CSA exam on a locked-down google form.  Did they cheat?  \n\n**FACTS:** Two students had very suspicious behavior on this time-consuming test.  They finished very early and one even dozed before handing it in.  One wore headphones which I didn't see until I asked him if he was ok, and the other wore a hood.  Both students always take the easy way through the course doing as little as possible.  Even my A+ students took almost an entire hour to do this exam.  VERY few turned them in even a few minutes early.  Both suspected students turned them in at the same time after about 35 minutes.  Both got an 85.  They did not have the same answers incorrect.  I have been suspicious before.\n\nCould someone have another student outside the room log into the google form - while the cheater is also logged in and in the classroom -- and take the test and submit it for them?  This person could just log into the test-takers account outside of the room and clicked the link when I posted it.\n\nI realize that they could have created a fake-looking exam and just sat there the entire time while LOOKING like they were taking the exam.  Then their friend, outside of the room, could take the test and have the ability to look up answers if needed.  This also concerns me because they could have copied all the questions and distributed them.\n\nCan I run screencastify while taking a google forms locked-down quiz?  \n\n**What other ways could they have cheated?**\n\nThe next exam will get a unique background and a bit.ly link that won't get posted.",

I work most afternoons during the week as well. Being an introverted person, when I actually finish work during the week I am glad to get alone time, peace and quiet.

In other words they have made a habit out of coming into class and immediately tuning out anything and everything the teacher says to the point that this is now ingrained in their routine and they way they approach learning in a classroom. \n\nIs this why student centric methods are now being pushed and admin is pushing hard for teachers to pretty much never do direct instruction (at least at my school)?

She was wearing just his shirt but it wasnt buttoned and both her boobs were like 100% visible. It was 9.30am so she obviously hooked up with my uncle the night before, he's a complete hoe, she kinda screamed and ran for the bedroom and I just stood there like a retard.\n\nMy uncle said hed talk to her and smooth things over and when he met us like an hour later in town he said it was cool. Thing is though since then shes been super weird in school. Like I havent told anyone cos that would be a dick move and I tried to just act normal but she wont even look at me in class and never calls on me or any thing. Also I got an assignment back and I got an A\\* I blatantly didnt deserve. \n\nSo heres where I need advice. Do I talk to her and try and fix this or should I just ignore it and hope she chills? Shes a really nice teacher and we were cool so I kinda want things to go back to how they were.",

From teachers who teach at average (I don't mean this in an offensive way, I just mean like in a less privilaged area) schools, what's the experience like teaching there? Is it as bad as the news and the books and movies make it seem? Is there lots of violence and drugs?\n\nLast thing, even though my high school is ranked so highly in academics, it's in the top 10 in the whole state, why do we still have rampant graffiti, vaping, class cutting, and \"devious licking\"?

        "body": "Hi, I'm a student teacher teaching 4th grade. \n\nI've been having so much fun in my practicum until the other day when this student came back. He's been absent for a few weeks now, so he hasn't spent any time with me in his classroom. As a newcomer, I've gotten used to giving directions and having some students ignore me. But this student is very vocal about me not being the boss of him and I don't know how to manage this kind of behaviour. It has made me hesitant to direct him or call out his bad behaviour because I know he's going to have something to say about it, but if I ignore him then he will think he's won this battle. I feel that I've been nothing but nice to him, but simply asking him if he needed a worksheet elicited a rude response. These responses tend to just be straight up refusals of my requests. For example, I asked him to join our class meeting circle several times just to be met with \"No! I don't want to! I'm not going to!\" \ud83e\udee0 Of course this was when I was being assessed by my university too.\ud83e\udd72 I realize I haven't had the luxury of developing connections with this student like I have with everyone else in the class, which is something I would like to do this week. But I know he won't be the last of his kind that I will face in my career. \n\nAny veteran teachers out there able to give me some words of wisdom?",

        "body": "I\u2019ve been on the record here about how I would never work for a charter, but man if things haven\u2019t gotten absolutely unsustainable in my district. It\u2019s terrible. I hate coming to work every day. I love the kids, but the workload and expectations from the district are downright awful. My principal is a bully. There is no discipline. I have written a child up for stealing expensive items (cell phones, tablets, etc) multiple times, and nothing has been done. It\u2019s an atmosphere of fear for the teachers, and a free-for-all for the behavior kids. Every time someone comes into your classroom, it\u2019s to nitpick what you are doing. Nothing can ever be right. \n\nMost of my kids are great. I have one child in particular who had a really hard year last year, and I worked so hard to connect with them, and the result has been incredible. That child is thriving despite a difficult home life. But the lack of support for the challenging students is exhausting. There is also no joy at my school. A coworker called it an academic penitentiary, which is an apt description. We aren\u2019t allowed to do anything fun because our scores are low, but then the children don\u2019t come to school because they also hate it here. Several of my kids have told me they come to school because they love to see me, but that they hate school. \n\nI toured a charter Montessori school on a whim. The pay is comparable. The insurance is better. They have high teacher retention and pretty much every staff member with an elementary-aged child sends their child there. The school was quiet and peaceful. The kids spoke so respectfully to one another and seemed to be very self-directed. And the school pays for your Montessori training. \n\nI don\u2019t want to leave public education, but it is really difficult to get into the neighboring municipal districts because good teachers are leaving my district in droves. I have never heard a bad word about this charter school, and I\u2019ve been asking around for awhile. I\u2019m just so tired of going to work every day and hating it. I feel so conflicted, but I also just want to actually like my job.",

In terms of marketablility to potential employers, does HGSE make a difference after a few years of teaching experience? After a decade? Harvard would mean something of an upheaval of my plans for a year while I am there, and an additional year of long distance with my long-term partner.

        "body": "So I teach a really tough group of 5th graders this year. You name a bad behavior, they've done it. There have been so many suspensions, lunch detentions, bullying, fights, etc. Needless to say, I'm exhausted and out of ideas to manage this group.\n\nAnyway, I teach ELA small group every day with both of my classes (we're departmentalized, so we switch in the middle of the day) at the end of the class time. I put up a slide with the group I'm meeting with that day and what the other students are expected to do at that time. They are either assigned to do Amplify on their laptops or independent work, which is practicing cursive at the moment. \n\nThe minute I get my small group on the carpet, a lot of them start talking and I can't teach the group without constant interruptions. I've modeled what it should look like, we've gone over expectations, given consequences to those who are talking, contacted parents, etc. Nothing I've tried is effective, and I'm ready to throw in the towel.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences and found a solution?\n\nI usually have another adult (para) with me in the room as well, but they still won't be quiet. I would love to hear what others have tried that has worked. Honestly, getting one of my classes to be quiet period is a challenge. There are a select number of kids who constantly disrupt class, make comments, etc. I'm out of ideas.",

        "body": "Hello, I am struggling at my lessons and I don't see eye to eye with my teacher and their teaching methods.. I guess I am searching for an outside opinion on my situation..\nSo a bit of a background. I was 25ish when I started taking classical singing lessons in our local public music school, so I was naturally the oldest among the new students, the reason being that I am not naturally talented and it took me years before I developed some range and self-confidence to even apply for tryouts. I had actually passed them and that was a huge boost for my confidence, though I still struggled with a bit of an imposter syndrome throughout my first year. \nAnd as it soon turned out, I didn't quite clique with my teacher.. Their teaching style is to stop me as soon as I make a mistake, which gets really frustrating when you try to sing a phrase, but you get stopped immediately after you open your mouth. And after 15 repetions with no feedback or tips that would be helpful to me, they got frustrated too, even though I'd be trying really hard to find that something. But the way they would proceed is to be angry at me for failing to do the thing, saying things like \"See how I do it? Just do the same-\", \"Why can't you do it? Tell me what is your problem?\" Like, how is that helpful?? \nSince I struggle with how I see and value my singing ability I progress best, when I get some positive feedback on my progress. But of course I get no such thing during lessons, only negative comments after being stopped every 10 seconds. I actually confronted my teacher about this, after they asked me, why am I so upset - I told them this, but they said that giving me praise would be lying, since what I'm doing isn't good/correct and I had really no answer to that, but is there really no way to give critique than that?\nSo I had a few confrontations, for lack of a better word, that left me really shaken, but the last one is the main reason why I am even writing this. The lesson didn't start well - I wasn't able to sing as well as on the previous one so we were both getting frustrated. They asked me again, why couldn't I do it as well as before and I didn't have a proper answer, so I replied that I just didn't have a great day mentally.. at that point they got quite angry, saying that their teaching method is good and that it isn't their problem that I can't  learn, since it is tested and they have rewards to show for it. They continued that it isn't their job as a teacher to deal with my depression, and that I need to sort that out  (I am taking medication and having therapy though) and not bring it into the singing. And that they aren't obligated to change anything in their teaching, and that the fault is is me, since I'm not practicing enough ( At this point they were shouting at me, yet I was so ashamed and confused that i didn't even prosess that until later. I barely made it home, before I collapsed I'm tears \ud83d\ude43)\n\nAnd like I get that they are a teacher and not a therapist, but I'm attending the lessons to learn singing not to cure my depression. But aren't teachers supposed to modify their teaching to suit their student, at least in one on one sessions? \n\nI'm sorry to bother you with this, but I don't know what to think anymore..",

He has lied about and lied to, his behavior has 3 others on my team not wanting to work where he works, they are starting to look for new jobs. Another person won't even take work assigned on our campus becasue of him. It's also been said that he has done similar things to at least 10 other teachers on our campus.\n\nSo to help out my team members who are now targets of his abuse, and since I found out I wasn't his only victim and people believe me now I am finally confident enough to write a statement about what he did to me last year but what words will trigger admin to get HR involved?",

A lot of people who have gotten diagnosed with this disease have gotten better, so I have faith that your mom will too.\n\nYou are balancing school, work, and family right now which honestly sounds like a lot, so I hope you are still able to find time to take care of yourself. I know I am just a random student, but if you ever need someone to talk to, please know that I am here. Stay strong.\n\nSending you love and positive energy.\n\n\nIs this too much?

I\u2019ve grown up around sarcasm and find myself to be a sarcastic person. I\u2019ve never taken it too far with the kids as they are only 10 and 11, but I\u2019ve connected with a lot of my students because of the fact that we\u2019re able to create a community that is both fun and educational. Long story short, my comments in class have reached a parent at home. Nothing even that bad, just the comments such as \u201cDid I ask?\u201d And those sort. This parents went above me and reported it right to my principal. Not once we\u2019re these concerns brought to my attention by this parent before she went to my admin. I was called in yesterday and basically told that sarcasm has no place in my classroom, was told \u201cto quit acting like a teenager because that\u2019s how teenagers joke with their friends\u201d, and \u201ci need to step up and be a good role model for my students\u201d and \u201cyou need to change the sarcasm and rise to the occasion.\u201d I left the meeting with my principal in tears. I have never felt so humiliated and unsupported by an admin in my life. This admin has been targeting me for months on end and has not said one nice word to me in months it feels like. \n\nI\u2019m at my wits end. I love my school. I love my kids. I love my coworkers. But the fact that i was so blatantly disrespected by my admin and not supported against a parent has me rethinking all of my choices. Any advice is really appreciated. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

I feel as if I didn't handle it the best. \n\nSo this is what happened: I handed back pop quizzes with a quiz correction sheet. The students were working together and I was bouncing back and forth between groups--keeping them on track, answering questions, explaining what they did wrong, etc. \n\nThere was one male student that blatantly cheated ny copying his neighbors work. I even asked the teacher next door on Wednesday what she thought.  She agreed. I called him out into the hallway, told him I lost his quiz somehow. I told him I made a new one and just changed some numbers. He seemed fine and I asked him he finished quickly last class, so i thought he would be fine. He agreed.\n\nI allowed him to work in the hall for ~30 minutes. I showed him his quiz vs. His neighbor's. I explained to him my reasoning. Then a student comes running put my room with pads in her hand. She is claiming another student is throwing pads at her, etc. She's all smiley and happy. I wall back in and tell her I'm talking with a student, ask that she and her friends be respectful, and to work on their work. I ask that they behave while I talk with said student.\n\nNot two minutes later and the pad holder comes out yet again laughing and having a good time. I hear commotion from the class. When I walk in, my alternate seat/ball chair/udder-looking-thing is being tossed around, even my decently behaved children are up running around, studentd are chasing each other, all havoc is loose.\n\nI leave, get the study hall teacher, enter again to digest the setting and completely scream:\n\n\"HEY!!! EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION. SIT DOWN. GO TO YOUR ASSIGNED SEATS.\"\n\nthey stare. Deer in headlights. Start moving.\n\n\"YOU ALL ARE ACTING LIKE KINDERGARTENERS. MY DEGREE IS IN SECONDARY EDUCATION. YOURE IN HIGH SCHOOL. ACT LIKE IT.\"\n\nI pause. Wait for everyone to get in their seats and ask that the study hall teacher remain in my class while I talk with said student.\n\nWhen I return I thank the teacher, ask him to leave, and I tell the class we will stay in our seats until the bell rings for us to go home (~2 minutes. Seriously). I have minor conversations with other students like... did you get your corrections done? Did you figure out that problem you needed help with? Yes, I will still accept your homework. What are you doing this weekend? Etc. I didnt get a negative mood from the class when they left for the day.\n\nSorry for the rant. I feel bad and felt I could have handled it better than screaming on the top of my lungs.\n\nTLDR; lost it on my class completely and am guilty that I could have set a better example.",

I'm going to keep things vague because I don't want to give away too much identifying information. \n\nBasically I taught for 6 years at Title One schools, and 3 were at this specific school. I left on my own terms to pursue other family and career goals and continue to sub at this school part time for some extra money and to do my former colleagues a favor because this school has so much terrible finding subs willing to work there. \n\nI was contacted by admin with a request to sub in arguably one of the hardest classes in this school. Apparently, many subs have quit and left mid day, and even the inductional coach was asked to sub in there one day and told me she struggled to manage that class. \n\nBut i agreed, trying to be helpful. I came in and already as soon as the class walked in the door wanted to start arguing/ fighting/ not following directions, so from then on I ran class like I was a drill sergeant and called admin repeatedly for student removals. But don't get me wrong, I had several one on one conferences with students to talk about issues and come up with plans. These students were given exceptionally clear directions and multiple chances to correct their behavior. \n\nAt about lunch time, several school staff members started coming into my room and sitting in the back. I assumed they were there to support. The whole day, I kept extensive data because there were so many calls to admin. At the end of the day I took the data directly to admin and that's when I was informed that some of the students whom I'd sent to the office had called me a racist, and that the staff who had been sent there were investigating my teaching!\n\nTbh I think this might be a formality because of the claims, but I'm just so taken aback! I've worked at this school for many years and continue to be one of the only subs willing to work here! I thought I was doing them a favor, and then they want to investigate me? It makes me not want to return; I need to protect myself and my career. \n\nStudent behavior at this school is even worse from when I left last year, and it's clear they know that they can do anything they want. It's so sad that admin would believe students' words over my own. If I call for intervention, there's a major issue. I kept extensive notes on every behavior and every intervention I tried before calling, and yet you still need to investigate this on Monday?",

When introducing Andrew Jackson , I said \u201cif y\u2019all think i hate thomas , just wait till you hear how much i had Andrew\u2026\u201d before i could finish ,brad yells \u201cYOU HATE ANDREW TATE? ALL FEMALES DO\u201d now , i learned the hard way how opening up discussion to that piece of shit never ends well. so i said \u201clast i checked andrew tate has yet to impact the Westward Expansion of the United States. so until he does , we don\u2019t talk about him in this class. \u201d \n\none of my other students then said \u201cyeah and he\u2019s admitted to rape. that\u2019s gross , brad.\u201d before i could cut it off again , brad says \u201cyeah w guy. i wish i could do that. why do you think i love him so much? he takes what he wants\u201d \n\ni told brad he can either get out of my class or stop talking. i wrote him up , and called his dad. only to find out from his dad , and other teachers , brad is a little misogynist because his dad is too. his dad got upset with me for talking over brad , and not letting brad express his opinions. \n\nnow i have wonderful admin at my school who backed me up , at least with how i handled brad. when i asked if i could get him transferred \u2026. different story. \n\ni am so upset. i feel like i lost control of my class , and i\u2019m stuck with brad , really not able to do anything. brad is also MUCH bigger than me i\u2019m 5\u20196 and brad is a 6\u20197, 270 pound weight lifter. i know this seems extreme , but i\u2019ve heard from other teachers that brad has said some inappropriate things about me\u2026 the dedication to get switched into my class and the rape comment definitely has me on edge. any advice is welcome.",

I have a lingering cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, and gastrointestinal issues that are still hanging on. My FMLA is up in a few weeks and the doctor is considering sending me back in with restrictions, if things keep going in this better direction. \n\nThe issue is he is very concerned about me getting sick again and staying hydrated. I've tried to explain that isn't a thing I have a lot of control over at work, but work is pushing back about the extended time away so we are trying to come to some solution. He can write that I need to be allowed to sit as needed, that shouldn't be an issue. \n\nThe concern is that getting Covid again would be life threatening. I don't see any acceptable accommodation that would keep me from close proximity to anyone ill (or at least an unmasked ill person) because Covid is still getting passed around the building like a hot potato and that's where I got it in the first place even wearing a mask. We have no testing or mask requirements so it's not going to get better any time soon. I also don't see an accommodation for frequent bathroom breaks being actionable. I am still dealing with urgent needs to go to the restroom that would be extremely embarrassing and we can't get coverage quick enough to meet that need.  \n\nShould I let him write the return to work note with those restrictions/accommodations and see what the school says? I'd love to hear from any other covid long haulers and their return to the classroom.",

The icing on the cake was a really rough observation report from admin. I decided to give myself one more year and if it was still bad then I would leave. This year I have the most wonderful group of students. Sure, they will sometimes stress me out but they are kind, respectful, and cooperative. Yesterday was my first observation of the year and it went so well. I scored almost perfectly. Admin even sent a newer teacher to talk to me for advice before her observation.

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just got back from a job fair in a different county that I want to get into, and I was offered a job in my first interview out of 6 scheduled interviews. Overall, I\u2019m extremely happy and excited about this opportunity because it\u2019s a school I want to go to, and the principal seems great. I\u2019ve wanted to leave this county for a few years now because I haven\u2019t been a big fan of how they run things. I\u2019ve also felt my current school has gotten more and more toxic over the last few years, and really want a fresh start. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m having one problem. My current principal and I don\u2019t see eye to eye, and she doesn\u2019t think highly of me. In my first 8 years of teaching, I was rated as a \u201chighly effective\u201d teacher, which is the highest level you can achieve. This year though she has given me bad scores, and we have gotten into a couple verbal disagreements. I\u2019m afraid she will give me a bad reference because it\u2019s very clear she doesn\u2019t see much in me. \n\nThe principal at the new school I was hired at said she has to call her just to make sure I\u2019m \u201cnot a terrible human being\u201d.  I thought about saying something about my principal possibly not giving me a good reference, but I didn\u2019t want her to have 2nd thoughts, so I decided to just be quiet and not mention anything. \n\nSo in the end, the new principal HAS to call my current one. I do have to speak to my current principal about the new job because I have to give her a paper to fill out for the new county.  I was thinking of possibly expressing to her in a heart to heart sort of way that I\u2019m just ready for something new because I\u2019ve been at this one school for my entire career, and need a fresh start. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "body": "[Article Link](https://6abc.com/upper-darby-school-district-superintendent-daniel-mcgarry-parents-students/12907981/)\n\n \n\n**Read the full letter from Upper Darby Superintendent Daniel McGarry:**\n\n*Good Evening Upper Darby Royals:*  \n\n\n*I send this communication with hope and optimism of better days ahead for us as a community, but recent student behaviors are unsettling to say the least. Over the past few months, the increase in physical altercations on the way to school or on the way home from school while walking or on our buses, conduct in our schools, and even conduct in the evening and over the weekend has to improve. I know that we can all do better. I have recently held meetings with the Upper Darby Police Department's Chief of Police, Mr. Timothy Bernhardt. We work together under a state-required Memo of Understanding (MOU) where local public school districts work with local law enforcement on promoting, sustaining, and responding to emergencies and student conduct in the community. In response to the increased community and school behaviors, we wanted to remind all of you of the following support(s) and resources we have available to students and families in need, and to also let everyone know that we will not tolerate threats of violence or acts of violence in our schools or community. We have to do better.*  \n\n\n*Proactively, the District has the following programs in place in our schools:*  \n\n\n*1. Youth Courts*  \n\n\n*2. Trained Restorative Justice Teams*  \n*3.* [*Student Assistance Program (SAP)*](https://www.findhelp.org/holcomb-behavioral-health-systems--exton-pa--the-student-assistance-program-%28sap%29/5114825236807680?postal=19008)  \n*4.* [*Trauma Informed Supports in partnership with Lakeside Neurologic*](https://www.lakesidetraining.org/)  \n*5. Conflict Resolution Supports in partnership with Child Guidance Resource Center in our schools*  \n*6. Crisis Prevention Institute - Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Training*  \n*7. State-Recognized Positive Behavior Intervention and Support Programs (PBIS)*  \n*8. K-12 Social and Emotional Learning Lessons*  \n*9. Building Level Equity Teams*  \n*10. Guidance Counselors and Social Workers*  \n*11. Parent Workshops and student assemblies in partnership with the District Attorney's Office on the perils of social media*  \n*12.* [*Safe2Say Something*](https://www.safe2saypa.org/)  \n*13. Developing a* [*TAPS program with local police*](https://www.tapsacademy.org/)  \n*14. Developing a* [*Youth Mentor Program*](https://go.boarddocs.com/pa/udar/Board.nsf/files/CPCSNT736C39/$file/Community%20Pride%20Through%20Youth%20Mentorship%20Presentation.pdf)  \n\n\n*15. Developing updated technology curriculum to include Digital Citizenship*  \n*16. Developing a* [*Fire Preparation Course Proposal*](https://go.boarddocs.com/pa/udar/Board.nsf/files/CLARDF6CF4CA/$file/Final%20Fire_EMT%20Course%20Presentation.pdf)  \n\n\n*We have staff and resources to help our students make better choices, but we need your help.*  \n\n\n*We can no longer tolerate the physical nature of recent behaviors in our schools, on our buses and in our community. We are putting our staff, our emergency responders, and other students in potentially unsafe situations. I have met with our Upper Darby Education Association union leadership, and again, our local law enforcement. Our staffs are worn out trying to provide our students the best they have to offer. We need your support. As parents/guardians, we ask that you please speak to your children about appropriate conduct on their way to and from school and in school. Please talk to them about treating one another with respect. I know we are still feeling the effects of the pandemic, and the last several months have been physically and emotionally draining, but our schools should be one of the safest places in a young person's life. We will continue to implement the plan we put in place since 2021 for students involved in the following at the secondary level:*  \n\n\n*1. Cutting classes and roaming the halls will result in a meeting with the Director of Secondary Education.*  \n*2. Physical conduct and fighting will not be tolerated. Students engaged in fighting will be brought to a hearing and removed from in-person instruction.*  \n*3. Social Media conduct outside of school and during the school are negatively impacting student behavior. Interactions between and among students via social media that interrupt the learning environment will result in a meeting with the Director of Secondary Education.*  \n*4. Students engaged in bullying and/or harassing both physically and via social media will be disciplined in accordance with our Code of Character*  \n*5. Negative student behavior on our buses will not be tolerated. We will expect parental support if students engage in negative behavior while on a district bus to and from school. Students engaged in negative behavior will receive discipline and possible removal from the bus.*  \n\n\n*I am asking for your help as a community to rally around one another to overcome this adversity. No one part of our school community can do it alone. We need all involved in supporting students to be and do their best.*  \n\n\n*Thank you for your attention to this very important message.*  \n\n\n*Daniel P. McGarry, Ed.D.*",

Anyway, she asked to see her guidance counselor. Our counselors are busy, and do not like us sending kids to them without appointments, which I understand. I simply asked if she had an appointment, she said no, and walked out anyway. I called their office real quick to let them know she was coming despite not having an appointment. \n\nAnyway, she came back about 20 minutes later, smiling and laughing saying \u201che gave me a lollipop!\u201d \n\nI saw the guidance counselor briefly after school. I apologized if she interrupted his day, and that she went down without my permission. He goes, \u201cNo I\u2019m happy she came down when she did, because she was about to do something to you she\u2019d probably get expelled for.\u201d \n\nNOW I know for a FACT if she talked about hurting another student, she\u2019d get suspended, and probably pulled from the class. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen our school do millions of times before. Why can\u2019t teachers have that same protection? This student also has an extensive history of getting into fights, so I know she\u2019s not scared to hurt somebody. So now I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her, I\u2019m scared to something that wouldn\u2019t make her happy.",

There is an opening next year in the school for a 3rd-5th special education teacher and I\u2019m being considered. Love the team, the school, and being with my kid. But my heart truly is in K-2. \n\nThey are opening a brand new magnet school in the district up the street from us and I\u2019ve been selected for an interview for a K or 1 position. We know of a lot of nice families who are going there and I\u2019ve heard great things about the principal. My kid has been waitlisted. \n\nBest case scenario- what if I\u2019m offered both? Is it better to be in a school where I know the culture and not love the position? Hope to grow to love it? We don\u2019t anticipate any lower school openings because of reduced enrollment with the magnet. Or try a new school and be part of creating a culture? It feels unethical to take a job in my current school if I might be biding my time until something else opens up. \n\nThanks in advance.",

Something I had been working on for years, as I sculpt outside of teaching. I thought it would be a wonderful classroom piece. I had yesterday off for personal reasons and came in around 3 to get a few supplies from the art room I needed at home to find the sculpture smashed all over the floor. Now it's sturdy enough to take some dings and sits naturally on the floor so this was definitely an act of maliciousness. Unfortunately I have no witnesses and no one to call accountable. The art room is normally locked and I was surprised to see it opened, so I'm not sure if this was a student or faculty but either way I am so angry and disappointed. Had to vent. Thank you",

Yesterday a student threatened to get me fired. Why you ask? I run a CTE program that is not properly funded(big shocker there) and I have been strongly encouraged to sell snacks and other items in my classes to help fund it.  I give my students the first two minutes of class to purchase these items. After that I will not sell them.  One of my more animated students started making a lot of noise about missing a dollar.  He demanded that I stop what I was doing and find it or the student that allegedly took it.  I refused. The kid called me a \u201cfucking asshole\u201d and then said he was going to get me fired.  I responded by closing up shop and told him \u201cWell let\u2019s do it! Let\u2019s go get me fired!\u201d And I told him to follow me to the office.  Unfortunately the principal wasn\u2019t there and was off campus.  Earlier some students of mine got caught using drugs on campus, and trying to get others to partake.  A paraprofessional tried to dictate how I was going to  grade a students essay  and I learned that I was going to lose a planning period to teach a subject I\u2019m not certified so that the teacher who has taught that subject for the last ten years can teach two periods of her own personal hobby. A hobby that the actual Art teacher should teach and is well qualified to teach. I learned this accidentally as I was not supposed to see next years planned schedules. \nI would not have objected had the powers that be simply asked me if I felt like teaching it.  Meanwhile, we need Reading teachers that know what they are doing , and instead we have paraprofessionals teaching the courses with no teacher oversight. I am certified in reading and have offered to teach a class or two but they would rather use me elsewhere.  \n\nIt\u2019s time for me to go! I have two interviews at other schools lined up for next week.",

        "body": "I'm a long-term public school sub in a title 1 district, which I started in late January after the previous teacher left mid-year. The courses I instruct are middle school science and high school biology, which aligns with my education and teaching experience. I've previously taught for five years at a cc before I moved to a different area to be closer to quality healthcare and left the workforce for two years to address my declining health. Now recovered, I chose to try teaching K12 since there is such a teacher shortage in my area.\n\nMy biology students have decided to dig up any public information they can find on me. They found that I had declared bankruptcy. They talk about it in the hallways, so now the other students in lower grades in my hallway also know. \n\nI'm already ashamed of having declared bankruptcy and trying to get back on track. It's so hurtful that these students dig up my past. I don't know how to handle this situation. I'm also trying to prepare for the day they find the public information that is available online that I had been abused as a child (the case went to the state supreme court and is now used as a study case for law students). \n\nThe main student that is digging actually asked me in class in front of everyone if I had filed for bankruptcy. I deflected the question in the moment as I was caught off guard. I know that if I deflect again the next time it's brought up, it'll be interpreted by the students as admitting to it. \n\nPlease, any advice is welcome. My best current idea is to legally change my first and last name but I know that will take time and is more of a solution for future teaching, not for this current school year. I don't want to talk to administration about it because I've asked them to hire me for a permanent position for the remainder of the year and am ashamed to talk about my bankruptcy.",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nAs the title suggests, I have a teacher who is forcing their students to write an essay about a specific topic.\n\nI'm a University student in Canada and this regards a History class. My teacher is telling us to write an essay with 3 distinct body paragraphs of 3 loosely related topics. The issue, and one I've never come across before, is they've given us extremely specific instructs about these paragraphs. They've given us the thesis and format of each paragraph as well as the arguments and sources we are meant to use. Are they allowed to do this?\n\nSomewhat related, but this \"history\" paper, for the History department, regards the linearity of time and its philosophical underpinnings regarding South Asian beliefs compared to Western beliefs and practices. Throughout the semester, this teacher has continuously drifted into philosophy and beliefs rather than focusing on the cold, hard facts of the history at hand. Is there anything I, or another/group of students, can do about having this class refocus on actual, proven events and eras of history? I've spoken to them outside of class about this and they outed me in front of everyone at the start of next class. Most people agreed with me so I don't really mind. They also started focusing a bit more on actual events as opposed to theology and beliefs but the exam content is still heavily focused on Philosophy and such.\n\nTLDR: My University History teacher is teaching us Philosophy and Theology instead of History. This teacher is now telling us what to write and what arguments to use. Can they do this? What can I do about having the topics/subjects refocused on History?",

He decided to do this a month ago and is going into his final round of interviews next week.  He has no qualifications whatsoever, has never stepped foot in a classroom, has never talked to a teacher about what teaching entails, talks about how the salary is good and how he'll get summers off, how it shouldn't be too hard because all he'll do is go in, do some activities with the kids, and go home, how he won't have to grade homework (because it's drama, not English class),  and how he'll help out with the shows.  He tutors kids a couple days a week, but spends most of that time silently grading papers in the corner.\n\nNow I may not be a teacher, but I don't think he has any idea what he's getting himself into.  Every single teacher friend I have has told me to tell him that he is wildly unprepared and not to do it.

My principal said something completely unnerving to me today and I was taken completely off-guard. \n\nI am in my 8th year teaching, but it is my first year in a new school in a new state. Things were not perfect at my last school but I did like it overall and didn't feel stressed (for the most part) or micromanaged. I ended up having to move to advance my pay just a bit. \n\nTo give some background, my one and only principal of 7 years wrote me a very nice, but very honest recommendation letter. His goal was to make sure that I wouldn't end up in a school that micromanages. He explained that I have my own very unique teaching style since I do not have a formal education in education. He explains that if I am trusted I will make sure my students pass their standardized tests, put their best interest first, and manage my classroom well. \n\nMy new principal (NP) offered me my job on the spot, I made sure NP read the recommendation letter, NP had, I signed on. I found out a week in that everything I was told was a lie. The micromanaging is the most toxic environment I have ever been in. I have been \"playing the game\" in my planning meetings, but then trying to do what is best for my students when I go into my classroom. Until today....\n\nWe are on the last day of quarter 3 and got pulled into NP's office today. NP told me that I am an embarrassment. NP said that I have been given multiple opportunities to prove that I actually know how to teach. I am lucky that I was able to bite my tongue and not unleash all of my feelings about the general BS and abuse I have dealt with the past months. \n\nI know that I am not going to be returning next year, but 1. do not want to lose my teaching license or have it suspended 2. do not want to leave my big babies with a long-term sub the rest of the year, so I need to stick it out two months. I can smell my principal's manipulation and \"break me down\" tricks a mile away, but my question is actually two questions. \n\n1. How do you deal with a toxic admin like this while you are waiting out the school year? \n2. What happens if this principal gives me a terrible recommendation? I don't want to lose my career because one person happens to be a POS. \n\nTYIA, TFIG.",

        "title": "Well, I might have gotten myself flunked out of my ARL program\u2026",
        "body": "Here is the gist of it. I got my degree in a different field in 2014. I worked really hard to get it. I had two young children and went through many obstacles to finish school. My husband\u2019s job caused us to move a lot, so I couldn\u2019t really get a career going during the time I was raising small children. I had two more after that. Now they are all school aged and I\u2019ve thought teaching would always be the default path. I worked as a special Ed para while I was finishing college and I loved working with kids. \n\nI live in a district where they are desperate for teachers, and begging for ARL candidates to get teachers in the pipeline. I was working as a sub, and they recruiter talked me into going to for my credential. I decided to do it. Within weeks, I was hired as a full time second grade teacher at a highly sought-after charter school with a long wait list, and enrolled in an alternative credential program. \n\nMy field supervisor came out today. He wanted to get one of the observations done. Since my job at the charter school already has steamrolled me into the ground with never ending PDs, meetings, observations, and extra tasks (I took over for a teacher who up and quit in the middle of the year and left the kids traumatized), I really wasn\u2019t expecting to be grilled like I was auditioning for America\u2019s Got Talent, but that was what it was. \n\n(Mind you, it is Friday, last hour of the day, at the end of book fair week. I\u2019ve already dealt with a lot of abuse from parents and children alike.)\n \nHe showed up 10 minutes early. I scrambled to get ready for him. We are supposed to do math workshops (games, center rotations) and so that was what we did. It started out well, but then there was some usual drama of kids calling out to me, arguing over who goes first, etc. I thought I did pretty good refocusing them. \n\nHe sent me a text on my phone and said to give him a call to debrief at the end of the day. When I left for the day and got my own kids in the car to go home, I called him outside my car. I thought it would be a quick \u201cthis is what I saw that was good, here is what I would suggest for next time\u201d kind of thing. It was not. He made me feel very intimidated and asked me how I thought I did, and what I could do to do better. He touched on the fact that he liked how I was doing centers. Then he tore into me on my classroom management and launched into a diatribe about CHAMPS and how I need to set clearer expectations. After he went on for a few minutes and started to grill me, he asked me if I understood, and I said yes, but I didn\u2019t know this was going going to turn into such a heavy conversation because it\u2019s Friday at the end of a long week and I was looking for help and suggestions, not lengthy criticism. He got super snotty and told me he had the power to contact the director and fail me out of the program. This of course pissed me off, so I reminded him that there was a teacher shortage and I can always not do this if I won\u2019t get help obtaining my credential. He just got really flustered and said we would talk later and he would be sure to give my principal his feedback. \n\nSo I guess I am screwed. Should I just get out now and eat the $5K? I\u2019m 39, I am too old to put up with this BS. Please advise.",

Many of these students have been at the school for years and have a history of intense behavioral needs. I have been asking for help and support since late September. \n\nMy admin decided to finally listen. They decided, \"let's do MTSS but for an entire homeroom!\" I didn't want to do it because that's not what MTSS is for, but alas, we did it anyways. At the initial meeting, I expressed the issue with a lack of empathy within my students and the intense behaviors. I was told that's not something trackable, so they wanted to track shouting out in the class. For a week, administrators were observing my and my literacy partner's classroom. They determined kids are shouting out more in my classroom than my partners after this week of observations. Apparently our administrators had nothing else to do that week, but are still too busy to answer emails in a timely manner.\n\nAt the next MTSS meeting, they disinvite my literacy partner and ambush me about how my teaching practice is causing all the behaviors and how I'm the problem. They want to take a deeper dive into what I need to be doing to support these kids more. Mind you, I've already asked my admin to come in and observe my management and give feedback several times due to the chaos. But, have they come in? Of course not.\n\nI'm so frustrated how I'm now being thrown under the bus for all these issues. I've worked with this administration for years and have never heard anything but praise. But I guess my evaluation doesn't support that I'm such a bad teacher, because they've offered me a position for next year. \n\nAnyone ever MTSS an entire class before? Tell me that's not actually a thing.",

I think that for this being my first year, I\u2019ve done a decent job. At the very least I\u2019m not doing the worst job. I usually have control over the classroom and I\u2019m always making the students actually work (this is high school- grades 9 and 11) which is more than I can say for some other teachers at my school that I hear about. There\u2019s a few things that are giving me the bad feeling about not being rehired back despite not being the most recent hire in my department: I have a big mouth and unfortunately don\u2019t know when to stop talking to coworkers so I\u2019ve mentioned that while I love my school and the environment, I would be highly upset about not getting one of the classes I listed as being what I would like to teach next year (and mentioned how since there\u2019s a teacher shortage I could probably go somewhere else to teach those classes if I couldn\u2019t here). Also my test scores have been low- however they have been low for all teachers in my subject this year and we landed ourselves last in the district over them. And finally, I became an assistant coach in a sport that I played throughout my childhood- into college, have assistant coached for years, and head coached for 1 year previously, and did not get along with the head coach. I tried my best and was never rude but we differed fundamentally on how to coach so she just never let me actually coach or have a say in anything. There were multiple complaints about her from parents and when admin asked me to explain the situation, I told them how incompetent she was and how I wouldn\u2019t help coach with her next year if everything remained the same. I regret saying that partly but I do stand by it- she constantly belittled me and my authority around the kids while simultaneously doing things she shouldn\u2019t as a coach and I just could not deal with that again. \n\nNo one has actually said anything about me not coming back or has ever expressed that I shouldn\u2019t, only the opposite actually, I just have a terrible feeling about the combination of those things. \n\nAny opinions? Should I be worried?",

I explain that my ability to control my classroom is being undermined because the students feel like the dean will just excuse consequences. That it sets a bad precedent for him to excuse consequences without at least speaking to me first. That allowing students to walk out of class makes my job harder. They argue that I was being disrespectful to the new admin. There's not really anything productive, if anything the whole meeting seemed more to call me out for \"bad attitude\".  \n\n\nCue today, when I'm teaching the same group of kids, and several of them decide to walk out of class when I try to redirect them. A couple get sent back, then walk out again when I tell them they are still receiving the consequence.   \n\n\nI can't wait to hear admin talking about how my classroom management strategies aren't good enough.

I also, and this is only partly related, got put on an improvement plan.\n\nFirst, I said no such thing before clearing it with her. I said I MIGHT be out Monday, and brought it up to my students in order to explain why I wasn't going to be delivering a test on Monday. I only confirmed it as certain AFTER clearing it with her.\n\nSecond, are you serious? Okay, well in that case I must say I found it a little disrespectful when I gave you an idea to resolve issues with midterms, you told me no, then called me in a week later to tell me I messed up and now I had to retest all three grades instead of give an extra ten points to the 7th grade with an essay like I originally wanted. That was a little disrespectful. I didn't really like the way you worded it to me.\n\nBut \\*everything\\* I do and say is constantly being watched and judged. Every. Single. Thing. If my tone is off I'm criticized for it. And now that I'm on an \"improvement plan\" the constant watching and judgment just got even worse. Just get me out of here already.",

I'm 35 years old and I still remember teachers who liked taking things away and it made me angry or feel belittled.  \n\nI'm kind of angry that teacher took away the kids Nintendo Switch.  I feel there could be more to that story, like this teacher aide always picks on this kid for his special needs.  And she's a 57 year old woman working as a teachers aide and not really a teacher.  If she really believed video games have no place in school, then why is she financially struggling because if she did well in school as a child she probably could get a better paying job.  Teacher's aid make something like $30k year then probably get taxed, so it seems like a job almost next to volunteering.  I think that woman hated her life and spends her time disciplining students because she needs a power trip.  And also she is divorced, which means she can't commit to a long term relationship.\n\nI can actually make money playing ticket redemption games which is like making money playing video games.  Getting iPads for cheap and keeping them or re-selling for a profit.  And I use a spread sheet on my iPhone to track every question I have.  Spreadsheet skills I learned from college and basic algebra skills to predict how much I can win a prize.  \n\nI brought my PSP and Nintendo DS to school and I never got it taken away maybe because we had cool teachers who were not karens.",

Thaaaat being said haha. A few months into the school year, another new teacher decided to quit. The school day ended, and they notified the principal that they would not be in tomorrow morning.\n\nCue the next morning and all of the teacher's students are asking questions about \"Where is our teacher?\" \"Is it our fault teacher is no longer here??\" And everyone told them *Nooooo of course not*. Let me tell you. These kids are downright horrible haha especially to new teachers. We got almost a full two months without a replacement teacher and finally after the holidays, during staff meeting, the principal announces that we have officially hired a replacement teacher! \"HOORAY!\" we all shout.\n\nFriends, replacement teacher did not even make it a month and a half. The first three weeks of which were either shadowing the leadership team member that was covering the class to learn how our school works and student's names, etc. The students were little monsters and two weeks ago, replacement teacher leaves before mid day crying and we none of us have heard from replacement teacher since. Again, all the questions start getting asked.\n\nLet me tell you, at this point, and after two weeks of the students reflecting. It is getting seriously hard not to say \"Yes. It 100% is your fault. Y'all are little shits and need to clean your attitude up because you are harassing people that are passionate about helping you *so* much, that you are making them quit their jobs.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was not sure what to flair this story as but it is crazy to me how insane things have gotten in the 10 years that I have been teaching.",

There are of course a few standouts who I've become close with but it feels like everyone else just hates my existence. I don't know if it's because I'm a short chubby fellow or because I've messed up a few times or because I have a very \"basement dweller\" sort of personality.\n\nI feel like it's probably the latter two though. I've been late 3 times this year, once almost an hour after my contracted work time, the one day I was out I didn't leave a roster for the sub and my whole desk area was a mess, I've been chewed out for forgetting to do a lot of stuff (paperwork I needed to turn in, being 2 days late with my slo, giving my students too much down time at the end of class, turning one of my lights off, one of my students slipped out once while I was busy helping another student.) \n\nOn top of that, everyone here is just so professional. They always dress super clean and are so put together, everything in their rooms are perfectly organized, they always bring these tiny lunches that they work through while they eat, they all watch if not coach a sport. Meanwhile half the time my hair looks like I was just in an explosion, my shirts have fuzz all over them, I have a long bushy beard, I have dark circles under my eyes still from my countless nights of no sleep college essays from last year, and I feel like I act more like my students than the people I work with. I play video games all night and watch anime and bring mcdonalds for my lunches. And I don't know a thing about most of the stuff they talk about. Politics and sports and there's small talk too, I just can't get small talk, I don't know how to do it, it feels like everyone else is an expert at all of this stuff and I'm just someone they're dragging along because math teachers are hard to find.\n\nI want to be like them. I want to be well liked and be, I guess, friends with everyone, but it feels like they only talk to me when they want to pity me or if it's related to something \"business\" related, like reminding me of something else I forgot to do. Meanwhile they're always chatting it up and laughing and talking about their families and I guess I'm just like jealous or something. I don't know.",

Our smart non math principle starts this conversation by looking at the data and notices no one passes the grade 8 Nys testing (that only 10 students took in 2018) thought that since no one is passing the 8th grade test they are telling us no to the 2 year algebra plan and instead we\u2019re trashing the 8th grade curriculum and start them with algebra. \n8th graders will learn about 7/10 units and be required to take the regents at the end of the year. If they pass they go to geometry if they fail they take another class to get them ready to take the regents again. It didn\u2019t make sense to me.\nAlso 7th grade becomes mix of 7/8.

        "body": "I'm a 3rd grade teaching intern (student teacher with extra rights and responsibilities) at a suburban Title 1 school. We have a lot of students who are struggling in reading and math, but one really sticks out from the rest in terms of math.\n\nDuring the last math test, about a month ago, I noticed she was struggling, so I started doing small-group support with her and a few other students who were behind during independent math time. She has been receiving small group instruction nearly every day since then. The other students in this group have improved, some of them only a little bit; others tremendously. However, this one student is, if anything, regressing. \n\nToday we had our math test on our multiplication and division strategies unit (they already did an intro to multiplication and intro to division unit before this unit, so we've been working on these concepts consistently for a very long time). She got a lower score than a student who has a diagnosed math disability. \n\nI've started to go back through my records from small group as well as other math work from this student. Here are my specific concerns with her math abilities:\n\n- She cannot reliably count past 30. \n\n- She cannot reliably skip-count by 2's or 5's. \n\n- She seems to conceptually understand what subtraction is and can explain what it means to subtract, but she doesn't subtract accurately and doesn't recognize when the answer she came up with doesn't make sense (for example, she said 11-4=11 and did not change her answer even after I walked her through why that would not be a plausible answer).\n\n- She does not seem to understand that there is a procedural difference between multiplying and dividing. She can verbalize that \u00d7 means multiplication and \u00f7 means division, but when she's asked to demonstrate how to solve a problem, she seems to choose randomly between the repeated addition method (a multiplication strategy) and the equal grouping method (a division strategy), disregarding what the operation sign signals.\n\n- We taught her how to use manipulatives to help her, and we let her use them for assignments, but she doesn't use them correctly even when we have gone over it with her on multiple occasions.\n\nSo, yeah... she is in third grade and is not even meeting the state standards for kindergarten math, even after doing a half hour of small group 4 times a week for a month. I'm honestly starting to suspect that she has dyscalculia or some other disability that disproportionately affects mathematical thinking. She has some executive function and attention challenges as well, but her difficulties in those areas don't seem to be outside the realm of what is developmentally typical for an 8-year-old. \n\nWe don't have an official math intervention system at the school, and we only have one special education teacher, who is already swamped. The teachers are not willing to entertain the idea of an IEP because she hasn't gone through tier 2 and tier 3 yet, but the reason she hasn't is because we don't have a system for tiers 2 and 3! \n\nHow in the world do I help this student get past these kindergarten and first grade level challenges while teaching third grade math to my class? Any advice is appreciated.",

We spend meetings talking about our why and watching inspirational Ted talks instead of looking at student work and collaboratively planning. \n\nIt\u2019s her first year as a coach and after several months of friction it came to light that she is being given grace because she has no training or experience in instructional coaching.

This has just been something on my mind and I wanted to see if others agree, especially with posts I see here.\n\nI currently teach elementary school but before I taught VPK/daycare.  I call myself \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by daycare because while I was working there, apparently, punishments were not allowed.  And by punishments I mean sitting in time out for 3-5 minutes during play time.  Actually, kids could not technically be rewarded.  For example, if one child behaved well and earned a sticker, everyone had to get one.  I think you can see how some would agree but disagree with this.  But because of this, I\u2019m afraid to give any type of repercussion even if the school allows it.\n\nNow I\u2019m in elementary school and apparently we can never tell a student their answer is wrong.  Even if they say 2 + 2 = 76 I still have to say they were \u201cright\u201d in some way.  While I  was in school (I'm 24), we were explicitly told if we were wrong, even if it embarrassed us.  If we misbehaved we were put in time out or embarrassed.  If we didn\u2019t do well on a test, without an accommodation or extenuating circumstances, we didn\u2019t get a makeup and without an accommodation or extenuating circumstance we didn\u2019t get extra time.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is when and why are teachers now forced to be lenient?

        "title": "High school teachers/coaches: is your school\u2019s athletic director an asshole?",
        "body": "TLDR: I hate my AD, would love to hear if I\u2019ve gotten unlucky or if all ADs have asshole tendencies like mine. \n\nMy current AD is the most self-righteous piece of work I\u2019ve had the misfortune to work with, and the AD at my last job was similar. This current guy acts as if he\u2019s too good for everyone because we have one of the top athletic programs in the nation. It\u2019s his second year. In no way/shape/form does he have anything to do with the program\u2019s success.\nHe has the audacity to stand in front of all the student-athletes and their parents at the beginning of the year and give the whole \u201cthe \u2018student\u2019 in \u2018student-athlete\u2019 comes first\u201d spiel, just to turn around and completely disregard any academic standards for the athletes or even the slightest prioritization of their studies (scheduling all sorts of events that require them to miss school, not holding them accountable for excessive tardies/absences, etc.). \nThe team that I am an assistant coach for had individual/team photos one day after school and a solid majority of the team skipped school all day so that they could get their hair/makeup done for these pictures. I cannot even begin to understand what could possibly take six hours to prepare to have your photo taken once. However, when I reached out to him with a lengthy email about the situation, explaining my concerns, he sent me back a one-sentence response with no substance whatsoever and proceeded to handle it in such a way that demonstrated he either didn\u2019t read my email at all (very likely) or that he completely disregarded the level of action I was asking of him (also very likely). He went directly to the head coach of my program after I asked him in the email not to, because I really just wanted to keep the AD in the loop on what some of his student-athletes were doing, and I didn\u2019t want my head coach to feel like I was going over his head. The head coach has numerous daughters on the team that also left school early to get ready for their photos, so I just knew that he was kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place, given that his wife was the one who made the decision for the girls to leave school early that day. He can\u2019t exactly tell any of the players they did wrong when his daughters were part of the issue. I would at least be grateful that the AD actually took some action in the situation, but no. He just reached out to my head coach and told him that he doesn\u2019t want to hear from me anymore, and any concerns about the program should go to him exclusively through the head coach. Keep in mind, I\u2019m not a coach who got a teaching job to be involved with the school, I am a teacher who got a coaching job to stay involved with some of my students\u2019 extracurriculars. Part of the reason that they hired me for this position (they reached out to me to do it, not the other way around) is \u201cto have an on-campus presence for the team\u201c. But then as soon as I reach out to him about an on-campus, academic concern, he doesn\u2019t want to hear it from me. After our games, he makes a clear effort to come and say hello to all of the other coaches and shake their hand, other than me. That\u2019s honestly the only thing he does that I like. \nThe final issue I have with him (by far the biggest) is that he is clearly sexist. Now, for the record, I\u2019m just about the last person to point at things and say \u201cthat\u2019s racist/sexist/any other ists\u201d, because I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I feel like more often than not, people use these just to try to shame people they don\u2019t like, which ultimately trivializes actual sexism and the like. This is not that. He\u2019s sexist. Our program is a consistent state title contender. We have numerous D1 recruits on the team who are both very talented and entertaining to watch compete. Even with all of that being true, our program is consistently treated like these girls are second-class citizens compared to their male equivalent team. Our practice location is constantly moved based on when/where the boys want to practice our head coach had to go find other places to play numerous home games other than our stadium because, after our schedule was already finalized, it was decided by the powers-that-be that the sprinklers would just need to be run at the exact time that our games are. When our head coach asked the athletic director where we were supposed to play those games, he was told to use his resources and find a location. You know, the athletic director\u2019s job? Luckily, our head coach is somehow known by everyone and their mother, and he got a relatively large local university to agree to host our home games for $500 per game. This may sound expensive, but I teach in a very affluent area and can assure you this would not be difficult to pull off for the school. After going back to the athletic director with this solution, our coach was told that the athletic director would \u201ccancel our entire season before he pays $500 for a game\u201d. This has not happened to the boy\u2019s team. In another situation, our team was warming up for a very important district rivalry game with a team-created, school-appropriate playlist playing over the loudspeakers. He cut off that music and proceeded to play one of the most embarrassing playlists I have ever heard, and said it was because they did not get the music approved by him before the game. First of all, he never told us we had to get the playlist approved by him and second of all, they were literally playing Beyonc\u00e9. The boy\u2019s team played after our game, and they walked out to NWA. They did not get their playlist turned off. Our team captains went to his office the next week in order to get the playlist approved, and they asked that if it could not be approved, could they just use the boys playlist. He said that that playlist had not been approved either, he just didn\u2019t want to cut them off mid warm-up. Apparently, the girls don\u2019t deserve that same level of respect. \nI could go on and on, more than I already have, but I think this paints the picture effectively. Are we alone, or is it just a pre-rec for athletic directors to be assholes?",

        "body": "Hey all, I have tricky situation that I could really use some guidance on.\n\nI have a 6th grade student who came out to me a few months ago as bi. Over a few weeks she worked up the courage to tell her parents despite knowing they wouldn't be supportive (evangelical christians). In the past few weeks, she's been showing me message exchanges between her and her mother that have become increasingly more horrid. Her mother originally set the bar by telling the girl that \"she has a demon inside of her\" and that \"she feels like a failure as a mother\". It has now escalated to the mother literally telling her \"God doesn't make mistakes and you are wrong for challenging God. You are a GIRL and girls are with BOYS. I will NEVER accept you\".\n\nY'all, this is the sweetest, kindest child in the world and she has latched on hard to me emotionally because I'm doing all I can to give her whatever support I can to the limits of a teacher. She has other teachers and friends to talk to, but she has just absolutely imprinted onto me emotionally. \n\nShe has never talked about harming herself, but I worry that with the horrible things her mother is saying to her, like telling a damn 6th grader she's a mistake is God, that she make start to get ideas. I've been montioring any signs of self harm or self harm thoughts incredibly closely. Now here's where it gets tricky....\n\nCounseling knows but hasn't helped. I haven't involved admin yet because I haven't had her permission and I do not want to out her to people she hasn't told and draw even more attention to it. I cant call CPS yet because there's no signs of abuse I've seen, said for the horrible things being said to her.  My heart is shattered for her and I'm trying to find as many resources as I can to help her, but ultimately she's stuck with her family. Dad doesn't seem to say anything about it. \n\nI'm just looking for any guidance on how I can help support her aside from lending my ear and offering her whatever advice I can. Everything in me wants to just give her a huge hug and tell her mother to fuck off, buuuuuut I know the boundaries as a teacher I have to respect. I'm also teetering on the border of what my legal obligations are to make reports before blowing up this child's life with CPS and what not.  All I know is she is in crisis and I feel powerless to help outside of what I've been able to do for her.",

I wanted out of that school IMMEDIATELY, but it was the aftermath of the 08 recession and my area was getting cut everywhere so jobs were scarce. I was pulled from my actual job to cover classes 40% of the time because everyone was so miserable we all took all our days. I don\u2019t fault my colleagues, it\u2019s the only way any of us survived. \n\nWhen I was finally able to apply for site-select (transfer to another school in the district), I chose schools with the highest teacher attendance rate. My logic, if the teachers want to come to work, it can\u2019t be that bad. \n\nI went from only having 2 fights a day being a good day, to only having 2 fights all year. I only had to cover 2 periods total that whole year. I was laid-off (again\u2026 stupid recession) so I didn\u2019t get to stay, but I really enjoyed working there. The kids were held accountable, there were multiple admin supports, a functioning discipline system, and I actually got to do my job.\n\nGive us support, hold kids accountable, and we\u2019ll gladly come to work as much as we can.

I get migraine attacks and so I usually bring my own pills but a couple times I ran out and asked her for some and she grudgingly gave them to me. I'm trying to avoid ever asking her again. When I mentioned it to admin they looked confused and went to her and she sweetly gave me some then and said it's fine. Then the next time, without admin, she was less nice about it and again made a point to say she's not supposed to be giving me any. \n\nOther schools I've worked at (same state, different districts) the nurses had no problem giving me some fucking ibuprofen. It makes me feel even more insulted as a teacher. We work hard all day listening to screeching children and they can't spare a little Advil?

I received an email this morning from a third grade teacher stating that she had a student that was not participating in a grade-level field trip and her student needed a classroom to visit for the morning. I volunteered to take him. He joined my class for about an hour until the phone rang\u2026.\n\nMy lead teacher called and asked if I had the student. I said yes, and she said he was not supposed to be in my classroom and I needed to send him down immediately. The tone in her voice was urgent. I apologized, telling her I had no idea he was not supposed to be here. \n\nMoments later, my principal jumped on the original email thread, CCing the assistant principal and lead teacher, and said \u201cwhat does this mean? Why is _________ going to first grade??\u201d (Yes, with two question marks.)\n\nI didn\u2019t reply, because I assumed she was talking to the student\u2019s teacher who sent him to me. I have so many questions?!\n\n1. What is the issue? What is the big deal? He was not attending a field trip and was in a safe classroom, helping out younger students. \n\n2. Why would my principal CC other administrators on this email? \n\nDoes anyone have any insight on what the issue may have been or why she CC\u2019d them? I don\u2019t know if I should have replied to the email, but I couldn\u2019t decide what to say, and didn\u2019t want to throw the other teacher under the bus, so I just left it alone. \n\nThanks!",

He\u2019s trying to put chew toys in his mouth and looks at the special needs kids doing it as though he wants their special treatment and tries copying their behaviour.

        "title": "Today was so hard.",
        "body": "I started the day by having my 8th grade nonreader students sort 2 and 3 letter words into groups based on shared letters because if I ask this 14 year old child to read them, they can't, and that's what my intervention book suggested as a next step. I send a debrief to the parents. (This is a tutoring program I run. During homeroom I pull a good 20 of the most struggling kids in small groups once a week to remediate on a quieter, more targeted level.) \n\nWe had an assembly which was changed last minute three times and was arranged so teachers like me (non core/electives) could attend, but I had to leave 10 minutes in because I had another class that wouldn't be at the assembly so they were coming to my room. I realize, due to my lockjaw and light sensitivity that I've got a migrane and take meds. I have 2 hours left in the day and so many people are out that I just decide to stick it out. \n\nDuring my 7th grade class another student I tutor, told me she needed to leave so she wouldn't hit someone, but she wasn't the only person upset. The quiet, well behaved kid who loves to draw threatened to stab a different girl with scissors. Half the students are trying to deescalate, get the scissors, ect. The other half aren't helping. The paranoid/anxious living roller coaster is yelling at him to just stab her already and he didn't even want to stab HER. \n\nI flagged down an admin and told him I don't think the child is a threat but he needs to sit in a room with an adult and decompress to make sure he won't be one. Of course the social worker, guidance counselor, and grade level dean were out. I send the parent a debrief, noting they should check in with him.\n\nMy sixth grade comes in and I can tell they will \"lose it.\" They've carried some drama with them that everyone has a hand in or opinion on, and this group is always ready to cry, scream, fight, or insult one another. They're primed and ready to go (get their revenge.) they're on a witchhunt to find out who reported the most popular girl in the classroom for watching porn. \n\nThey're having a productive conversation (moving away from witch hunting and more processing it) so I just leave them to it, not that I had much of a choice as three kids cry and two hurt their knees (which is why they cried.) and one student calls me over to ask pointed questions about my parents and what society does to parents who hurt their kids. So I do a quick informal investigation to see if she's the one being harmed, but she insists she isn't. That her parents \"just\" insult her and push her too hard.\n\nI figure she's likely holding something back so I tell her she should talk with the social worker when the social worker gets back to figure out her next steps.\n\nThen I turn around and see two kids locked on one another, ready to fight. I get in the middle. This is a controversial move but I didn't even think twice about it. But it was proven why it was a controversial move as one of them hit me trying to get to the other. It didn't hurt (these kids look like they're 8) but it gets a new contingent of the class riled up because, as angry and wound up as this group is, they're extremely protective of each other. And me, apparently. I press the button for the office but another staff member heard the yelling and came to help before the office could even respond. He took the two kids out who were fighting and I try and give the class one of my speeches. Every class gets it, eventually. Be kind.\n\nI've been trying to get them to understand for months that this cycle of pranks turning into fights is something they can stop. That they're all hurt, and trying to make others feel that hurt and they need to stop. I end the 3 minute speech 10 minutes after starting because they won't shut up long enough for me to get a word out. I end it with a reminder that, if they wouldn't stop hurting each other because they have empathy, stop because everyone in that room will fight back, and they know that for a fact.\n\nI'm taking a break before I debrief the parents. I want to cry, because I'm deeply sad for these babies but also a bit frustrated at how damn hard it is to have a good day at my school. But I did that on Monday after admin told me they could do nothing about my 6th graders purposely breaking 3 classroom chromebooks in one class period because I didn't personally witness it happening so I can't. I'm cried out. (I took away the classroom chromebooks from everyone indefinitely. I'll get pushback from my district level supervisor but I'm doing it anyway.)\n\nYesterday two school principals responded to my application for the next school year so I'm holding to that, and the ice cream I'm going to get even though I'm experiencing stress induced stomach pain, again. I needed to vent this somewhere where people would understand.",

        "body": "To provide some context, For our final assignment before graduation, My teacher put us in groups where we all had to pick a major topic and then find sub-topics individually within the main topic. We then had to write an argumentative essay, an article, an article review, and an informative essay together as a group mixing in all of the information we gathered individually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, my group's main topic was sexism and I decided to make my subtopic \"Discrimination faced by women in the twenty-first century\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to find an article about my topic, and review that article paying close attention to the literary devices that were used as well as how the article was organized. I then had to write my own article, argumentative essay, and informative essay on the topic.\n\nOnce everyone in the group was done with their individual portions we all had to come together to right one major essay together that took all the information we gathered together in one place. Any of your group members could help you with any one of your individual portions during class and it was highly advised to do so.\n\nI messaged my teacher like all my group members had to tell him what specific topic I was going to use and he told me that instead of doing \"discrimination of modern day women do your article about the discrimination women faced during the time of the suffragettes\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was confused about this because I knew that another guy in my group was doing my exact topic but reversed \"Discrimination faced by men in modern times\" and to my knowledge, he got the green light without any further questioning just the day before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to ask for clarification the following day he told me that I had been removed from his class. I asked him since when to which he replied \"since November\" he's telling me that right before the semester ends. when I asked why he told me that the system automatically removes you when you have low attendance\" I had health severe issues back at the beginning of the semester which impaired my ability to attend school, but I started coming back in December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had already made the school aware of this and was not removed from any of my other classes due to this issue and if I was removed from the class all the way back in November why the hell did he make me come back to class, do assignments and form a group in the first place?\n\n \n\nHe\u2019s never once communicated with my parents or anyone for months. He told me this right after I made the assignment, which proves that he purposely removed me because I have different views than him. He claimed to have \u201csent an email\u201d to my parents, which we never managed to find nor did he ever prove that he sent it.\n\n \n\nSo, for the past 2 months I\u2019ve been catching up on assignments and turning them into the Google Classroom for nothing. He hasn\u2019t even marked my assignments yet. I don\u2019t get actual marks from the Google Classroom, they have to be transferred to my school account. He purposely has not marked my assignments because he wants me to fail.\n\nI talked to the principal about the Sexism assignment, so she added me back to my class. but here\u2019s the thing, my teacher still isn\u2019t marking my assignments because he doesn\u2019t agree with my views.\n\nmy mom asked the principal if somebody else can mark my assignments because they\u2019re not accurate. She said \u201cI can\u2019t promise anything\u201d.\n\nhow can I prove my teacher is purposely is not grading me and giving me bad grades because he disagrees with my views, and wants me to fail his class?",

She wrote back saying she could help me finish it and it\u2019s only three more months of work.  Then said I can get paid up to 24 hours.  However I\u2019ve already put in 27 hours (and have been emailing her my hours).  Then, in email she said her advice is to finish the project because \u201cyou don\u2019t get paid until the project is finished\u201d. \n\nThen I spoke to a union rep and asked her \u201cwill I get paid if I don\u2019t finish?\u201d She said let me go ask the executive board.Well she just told me that there has never been anyone in the district who didn\u2019t finish and that she is unsure if they would pay me.  \n\nDoing the project has been stressful and stress makes my illness worse. Should I still to my word and not do it even though I might not get paid? Does your district pay you if you drop out due to health reasons? \n\nI really don\u2019t wanna do its Been run with vague feedback.  Minor detail I\u2019m new to this district without tenure. Can they really not pay me?  Blackmail?",

Would it be weird to contact the school (recruiter, principal/vice principal?) to request a visit? Do you think they\u2019d even look at my application knowing I can\u2019t come in for a face-to-face interview?\n\nI might be overthinking this, but I don\u2019t have much teaching experience so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s appropriate in this situation!\n\nAny input is appreciated!

        "body": "This is a long newsletter I follow. The whole text is too long to publish. The relevant bit is this:\n\n\\---\n\nThe same people that have invented ChatGTP, a company called OpenAI, are hard at work to create a technique that can help identify text generated by their own AI. It\u2019s a technique called *watermarking*.\n\nWatermarking synthetic text requires that the AI generates a specific subset of words from its vast vocabulary, but uses them in a way that is transparent to the users.\n\nUniversity teachers might have to learn how to use these watermarking identification systems. Last quote from the New York Times article:\n\n&gt;More than 6,000 teachers from Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Rhode Island and others have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that promises to quickly detect A.I.-generated text, said Edward Tian, its creator and a senior at Princeton University.\n\nBy January 25th, the total number of teachers on the waiting list for GPTZero was [23,000](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/professors-turn-to-chatgpt-to-teach-students-a-lesson-11674657460).\n\nIf you are a teacher reading this newsletter, before you rush to try [the tool](https://gptzero.me/), you should know that there is a plot twist.  \nSame, if you are an entrepreneur and you are already planning a clone of GPTZero.\n\nSo far, not even OpenIA has been successful in identifying synthetic text. They created a tool to do that, and it does not work well, [as they warned at the end of January:](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/)\n\n&gt;Our classifier is not fully reliable. In our evaluations on a \u201cchallenge set\u201d of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as \u201clikely AI-written,\u201d while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).  \n\u2026  \nOur classifier has a number of important limitations. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool  \n\u2026  \nThe classifier is very unreliable on short texts (below 1,000 characters). Even longer texts are sometimes incorrectly labeled by the classifier.  \n\u2026  \nSometimes human-written text will be incorrectly but confidently labeled as AI-written by our classifier.  \n\u2026  \nWe recommend using the classifier only for English text. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code.\n\nNow back to the mad rush to use GPTZero: what are the chances that this tool performs better than the tool invented by top AI experts in the world? Also: can the school be dragged to court if a teacher unjustly accuses a student of cheating by submitting synthetic essays?\n\n\\---\n\nIf you are interested, the rest is here: [https://synthetic.work/splendid-edition/issue-1-burn-the-books-ban-ai-screwed-teachers-middle-ages-are-so-sexy/](https://synthetic.work/splendid-edition/issue-1-burn-the-books-ban-ai-screwed-teachers-middle-ages-are-so-sexy/)",

I\u2019m looking for suggestions from anyone who has already gone down this path or who has looked into it more than me. We live in Raleigh, NC if that helps.",

In August, in the beginning of the school year. I have had problems with my \"associate teacher\" from day one. I was warned by the teacher last year that my new associate teacher \"Miss Bee\" would be trying to take over my classroom. However, it is so bad I cant take it. I think about when I go home and when I wake up in the morning. I know other teachers would love an overly helpful assistant. But she is overboard to the point people dont even talk to me when they enter my class they talk to her because they think she is the lead. She is always trying to takeover things that are not in her position or role. We already had a discussion with the principal about this problem but it keeps happening. I was told that she has a form of anxiety related to getting tasks and completing more masks that are outside of her role. She has to stay busy. I honestly think she has some form of OCD and ADHD but I am just a graduate student in psychology, what do I know.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the former staff know about her ways but it doesn't really impact them negatively because no one works as closely with her as I do. I do feel appreciated and acknowledged for my hard work at this job by leadership. But I find that a lot of the parents and staff think she is the one in charge of my classroom instead of me. This hurts my feelings because I am 24, I just graduated college, and I've been dying to feel in charge of my own room. Any advice on what I should do? Because lately I am just getting annoyed with her and making my frustrations with her visible through my attitude. Which is super not professional and it's not gonna help me move up here which I really want to. Also, I will say my assistant is a fully licensed teacher but she struggled leading by herself. I still see several teaching and logical issues within her teaching practices. How do I stop myself from raging and having an attitude. I'm literally so pissed at work typing this.",

That's lower than the overall U.S. jobless rate of  3.9%.\n\nUnlike manufacturers or skilled labor employment found in  accounting, healthcare and construction, the education sector does not  produce a purchasable product or service, making it particularly  susceptible to layoffs during economic downturn.\u00a0\n\nJobs  in the education industry include K-12 and higher ed positions in  teaching and administration. Finance leaders in the industry expect  layoffs if U.S. hits economic recession in 2023.\u00a0 (Fox News)\n\nData compiled by Zippia showed the educational services have already lost 136,000 employees from June 2021 to June 2022.\n\nGovernment  data shows 3.88 million people worked in educational services in  January, a broad category comprising teachers from elementary schools to  college professors, to workers in business, technical, and other  schools, along with support workers.\n\nOther sectors most impacted  by looming recession include Communications with 60% of the sector\u2019s  CFOs pointing to layoffs as a solution, while Utilities, Law and Science  round out the top five with 50% of CFOs from each industry saying they  would reduce their workforces this year.\n\nOnly 20% of healthcare CFOs think layoffs will impact healthcare in 2023.\u00a0 (Getty Images)\n\nAccording  to the study, only 20% of CFOs in healthcare and accounting think  layoffs are on the table over the next six to 12 months, while just 17%  of CFOs asked in the entertainment industry said they thought job cuts  would impact businesses. \u00a0\n\nWith 86% of CFOs saying layoffs are a  last resort, Tiscornia said talent and people remain a company\u2019s biggest  asset and should be treated as such.\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/education-employment-highest-risk-layoffs-6-months-100-sectors-cfos-agree](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/education-employment-highest-risk-layoffs-6-months-100-sectors-cfos-agree)",

I always want to give my students the benefit of the doubt, but I also want them to do their own work.

Googling and browsing the usual suspects hasn't worked, and I don't think it was written by a.i.

Just curious to hear if others experience the same stuff.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nTeaching does not have much respect - perhaps this differs from district to district, but I don't see it. Here's how I know:\n\n1. I made nearly the same money over 25 years ago working for the central office that I make now in the classroom.\n2. If teachers are missing from a school, there is not much concern. If schools are closed, the world ends. My school had 3/4 admin leave last year and NONE were replaced until the following year. Good times.\n3. You will ALWAYS be encouraged/required to think of the job as a calling, but that can easily turn into gaslighting.\n4. Your job is really to \"legitimately\" pass as many people as you can. There really are no standards that will be enforced. Attendence is becoming optional and grades are completely inflated.\n5. Your central office's priorities will not likely align with yours. They are political creatures there and so is the school board. The onus for \"fixing\" things, however, will be on you. Social, educational, emotional, etc. - all on you.\n6. You MUST, MUST, MUST document what you do. When it comes to hard times, your admin is not likely to have your back, neither will the union (if you have one).\n7. You can't prove a negative. If you are accused of bias or something like that, the accusation will be hard to shake.\n8. You will have to constantly advocate for everything you need. There is no one making sure you have working desks, etc.\n9. At some point, you WILL spend your own money to make your classroom, instruction, library, better.\n10. Kids WILL be on their cell phone and, short of dynamite, I don't know what to do with that.\n11. If you live in a college town (I do), everyone thinks they know more than you do - about education, kids, your content areas.\n12. Don't expect parents to value the institution of school if it comes into conflict with their kid.\n13. You will spend LOTS of time doing work outside of school, for which you will not be recognized or paid.\n14. You WILL be micromanaged. It's the only real reason the central office exists.",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nSince high school, I've often wondered what teachers think about students who are shy or introverted and don't participate much in class. I happen to be one of these students, and every year when we get our results, my teachers make the same comment: I should talk and participate more. One time, a teacher even called my mom and told her I could do much better if I participated more. Unfortunately, this caused a lot of problems because my parents blamed my shyness for my grades, when in reality, I'm not a bad student. I have decent grades and, while it's important to strive for excellence, I don't believe that participating more would make a significant difference as long as I'm focused in class. In fact, the top student in my class doesn't participate at all, yet still manages to achieve excellent grades.\n\nI'd also like to emphasize that my lack of participation has nothing to do with a lack of interest or motivation. I suffer from social anxiety, and although I wish I could speak up more often, it's easier said than done.\n\nWith that being said, I'm curious to know why some teachers insist on forcing shy or anxious students to participate more. While I understand the importance of public speaking during presentations, I don't see how it's relevant when the only thing that really matters are the grades.",

So I grabbed the trash can, held it in front of her and made a scene like, \u201cI. Am. The trash monster! I am hungry! Feed me sour sticks and M&amp;Ms! Rwaaar!\u201d\n\nIt was a skit my 3 year old would have adored. \n\nSo the freshmen immediately next to her got in a laughing fit and they were all mutually embarrassed and then she asked if she could put her food away so that the trash monster would leave. I agreed. \n\nAnd now there\u2019s an ongoing thing where the kids urge others to not make me get out the trash monster. I\u2019m totally unashamed of the trash monster, but they are mortified. \n\nAnother group, sophomores, like to shout across the room. So I go to each one individually and make sure I overload them with Lots.Of.Attention. \u201cI hear your shouting across the room and I came to see what\u2019s up.  Do you need help? Oh look at this answer, you\u2019re doing so well! Is your group working out? The way you were yelling in the room, I thought you must be needing some extra attention so here I am giving it to you! Lots of attention. Loooots. Of. Attention.  Any questions? No? Are you suuuure? See? Attention! You have my undivided attention, so if you\u2019ve got anything to ask me, now is the time!\u201d\n\nBy then they\u2019re asking me to leave, and I do. \n\nAnother kid just straight up started ignoring me and went back to work, which hey! That\u2019s ideal. \n\nSome of the other teachers have started to ask \u201cdo you need attention\u201d, to great success. They only have to say those words to set off whatever mental trauma I\u2019ve inflicted. \n\nAnother odd thing is how I use words. I\u2019ve noticed they say \u201csus\u201d instead of \u201csuspicious\u201d and so I occasionally throw out a \u201cthat seems really suspich\u201d and that embarrasses them, too. I don\u2019t get why, but it\u2019ll usually stop the wayward conversation better than a straightforward redirect will. \n\nI\u2019ll also take a phrase they\u2019re being annoying with and sing a little impromptu ditty with it to the tune of some random Cocomelon song, which again embarrasses them. I need to find a way to bastardize their \u201c I took a waaaaaalk to Poland \u201c song snippet thing that they like to blurt out. \n\nI\u2019m serious I\u2019ve tried just about everything I possibly can to control the behavior, but without solid administration support, nothing sticks. Sending a kid to the principal is just nothing to them, it\u2019s incredible. Write ups take two weeks to go no where.  The teachers who have been teaching ten+ years say or current sophomores are a real struggle. \n\n\n I\u2019m also 5\u20191\u201d and the way people usually describe me is \u201ccute and friendly\u201d, so I\u2019m hardly intimidating even in my worst mood. I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t get angry because others usually laugh at me the madder I get. \u201cIt\u2019s like an angry Ewok, you\u2019re so cute!\u201d is something I\u2019ve not been able to forget. \n\nSo anyway, is this management style a thing that other teachers do and from whom I can learn and perfect my art?",

Turns out that this kid's mom had sent an email demanding that her son be moved to another class because another parent had shouted at her son. My deputy then spoke to this kid to find out more about this. Turns out that the other parent is their neighbor and shouted at him at his house. So now the deputy is meeting with the mom to tell her to sort out her home issues herself and her kid is staying where he is. \n\nI really don't get some parents, and there I was thinking that I had lucked out this year with having fairly easy parents. Now I am not looking forward to meeting this mom in two weeks with our parent-teacher conferences even though the kid is amazing",

Parents of the student feed onto this behavior and act like we're the bad guys when we bring the behavior to their attention. What makes this more difficult to deal with is one of the child's parents is on campus frequently and feeds into the child's drama whenever they cross paths with this. The reason for tantrums is never justified either. It's anything from someone else who has the playground equipment they want, to they don't want to do an assignment, to they don't like their lunch. Admin is trying, but I am at my wits' end. Any suggestions on how to de-escalate the behavior and ultimately get it to stop. \n\nThey also have zero shame in doing this in front of their class or the entire cafeteria, yet they and their parents are perplexed as to why the child can't make and keep friends.",

There's a teacher traumatizing her saying things and guilt tripping her about how she \"doesn't know her anymore\" (we've went through a lot since then - dad passed, family shifts, mental health issues), and a lot more hurtful, personal things a teacher shouldn't say to a student like that. Countless times, my sister came home to talk to me about said teacher and how she's made her cry in school just from words. Then, she makes her hurry to the restroom to clean up. My sister tried many times to explain things politely and stand up for herself like I tell her to, but she gets shut up with the old \"stop talking back to me or you'll get sent to the office.\" She even went to the vice principal to share her opinion, and he was like, \"It's not about what the students think. If the parents have a problem, they can speak to us ourselves.\"\n\nThat's when I really got mad. This certain teacher really is an issue, and my sister can't even talk about it to anyone. They just view her as a child. Okay, true. But these children, they're not just children. They have things to say, and they should be able to say certain things without getting punished. And then people wonder why so many of us grow up with social anxiety and want to blame phones. Another true, but my own partially came from the school system and being forced to conform to \"be quiet and you won't be punished.\" Now, i have trouble speaking up, speaking out, and standing up for myself. I want my sister to be the opposite of this - to speak out, to be bold, to ask questions, and to stand up for herself. But she can't. \n\nToday was the last straw when, yet again, i heard the same story of that teacher making her cry in class from hurtful words. And yes, my sister knows the difference between respectful, asshole teachers and just plain assholes who are being hurtful.\n\nOur mother can't stand up for her either because, honestly, she does not care. My sister looks to me as another mother who actually listens to her. Is there anything I can do for her as the older sister?",

It used to be that much every week. \n\nI am pretty efficient and get all of my work done before most of the other teachers. Many of the other teachers often ask me for my lesson plans or different activities I've planned to save them time. I have been this person for 2 years and I like helping other people and ultimately the students. HOWEVER, out of 12 teachers there is only 1-2 that EVER volunteer anything to the group. I am really starting to get sick of it and I hate the way it's making me feel. I'm getting this petty feeling and urge to not share anything with anyone anymore. Even if I shared something 10 times a month and they only shared once, it would at least be SOMETHING. Something that shows that they are at least trying to contribute instead of just taking constantly. They aren't contributing at all and I'm getting more and more frustrated with the situation. I hate that it's turned me into someone that used to be a team player into a grumpy teacher. \n\nI've asked for a few volunteers in the past to put something simple together like a gimkit/blooket/etc to go along with a weekly lesson I share, but they don't even make one. They will find something in 2 seconds that's already made on the websites and isn't even grade level appropriate. \n\nAny advice? Should I say something? Should I be super petty and stop sharing my stuff? (I would just say I didn't plan anything yet in an evasive, but not rude way.) I'm pretty open and straightforward with most things and really like all my co-workers as people. I know that everyone is busy and really just doesn't have a lot of time to plan and I don't think it's malicious.

She seems like such a sweet girl and She gets the educational support she needs. \n\nI wanted to see how much English she knew so I complimented her hair. When I asked her who did it for her, she said \u201cthank you\u201d. Ok. Not much English, but i assume she will pick it up, as kids do (which I\u2019m jealous of lol). \n\nI talk with the 1st graders a lot as I see them and have gotten to know a few of them.\n\nI don\u2019t know much Spanish. I can say some basic things but i cannot hold a conversation. I try to include her as I often see her looking at other students for her cue to grab her bag, and things like that. Today, i wanted to tell her that i liked her headband. I pointed to it and say \u201cbonita!\u201d  \n\nSo I guess my question is - any advice?  \n\nAs stated before, i got to know a couple other students in this class. I want to get to know her more but i don\u2019t want to come across as the annoying white woman who thinks she knows Spanish when she doesn\u2019t. \n\nAny advice? \n\nSorry if this post is everywhere. I\u2019m studying to be a teacher and i am working at the same time so I am trying to learn as I work.",

        "title": "RANT anyone else really hating social workers?",
        "body": "Ok so I taught in Title I schools for the past two decades in a few different states. I considered myself to be an intuitive, compassionate primary teacher who navigated bullshit on all sides skillfully and I was pretty well-regarded for prioritizing community, belonging, relationship, and SEL. However, my last and final year I just couldn't do it anymore and decided to leave the profession for something that has a more focused aim. I started in an MSW program last fall in Chicago and need somewhere to vent about how sanctimonious, judgemental, and dogmatic/lacking perspective the social workers I am encountering are.\n\nGenerally speaking, the SWers in my classes and at my internship seem to blame/scapegoat teachers for nearly all failings in classrooms and schools. I will be the very first to acknowledge it is not a perfect system by any means, which is why I ultimately needed to leave but it's also incredibly complex, with many groups (each of which has its own ideas and perspectives about what's happening and what should be different). And teachers are walking a pretty impossible line of pleasing everyone, and being the only people in the buildings who know how to do everyone else's job (including a SWer) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY are also the only group who can't just say \"that's not my job\" because everyone is always dumping the responsibilities on them. So fucking heavy is the load! \n\nSWers talk about walking into classrooms and why don't teachers know how important it is to have a low-stimulation environment because there are students who have traumatic experiences in their lives? Of course this one kid they are there to observe has meltdowns, the teacher should have the room set up to be less colorful and less noisy. That teacher should have some education or PD on trauma informed care/crisis intervention/best practices for kids with ACEs. Like in the time I taught, this is pretty much exclusively what I got training in at my districts. I also was pretty interested in it so read quite a bit on my own time, as well. It's not that teachers don't know, it's that given the environment of having 28 other 1st graders, they are managing a pretty impossible task of attempting to meet each one's specific needs and then being criticized for not succeeding. It would, and is, a completely different job to work at the individual level with each kid.\n\nThere are often meetings for kiddos in schools who are biting teachers, or whatever etc. And instead of aiding the process, these SWers constipate the process by calling parents and encouraging them to refuse the system's protocols for emotional disturbance assessment (or whatever IEP qualifying category). They say what's the rush? Why push this kid who is struggling down a path that will label them forever? Shouldn't special education be set up differently? The family doesn't feel heard in these meetings and that causes harm. They say this kid doesn't have mental health problems or behavior problems, this kid has trauma and schools should be set up better. Well, they're not unfortunately and timing is of the essence (especially early on in schooling) and this is kind of the best they can do...so why not aid that process? \n\nSWers have no understanding of the INDIVIDUAL IN THE COMMUNITY level focus...teachers do not have the luxury of being individually focused (as a SWer is) because they are managing a whole fucking ecosystem of people. \n\nWhen a kindergartener runs out of his classroom because he told his teacher he was hungry (15 minutes to lunch) and she told him to wait. Instead of telling him to go back, SWers play games with him, give him a snack, congratulate him on advocating for his needs. And then gossip about how that teacher lacks compassion. If a kindergarten teacher gave every kid a snack when they asked, she wouldn't be a teacher anymore. She'd be a waitress. There have to be some lines and some hard no's. It's so frustrating because they think they're helping but they are undermining a salaried professional, who has taken courses in child development and likely has a master's degree. And those teachers will quit soon if they don't get some fucking support! Why can social workers appreciate all the reasons for the behaviors of students and families, but not teachers? Where is the love for these hardworking people? Are teachers not also trapped as agents in broken systems with limited resources and means? \n\nSWers talk about \"behaviors\" and patronizingly use air quotes- like don't the teachers know behaviors are cries for help??? These are needs they are trying to express. First, of course teachers know that!!! But also, that isn't what schools or classrooms are set up for.\nSWers say, \"what if that kid has problems at home?\" Of fucking course that kid has problems at home!!! Schools do not have magic wands and I guarantee that if they were trapped with a kid who's biting them, they'd also want to figure something out.\n\nI also HATE hearing the language of how SWers are \"revolutionaries within the system,\" like...no sorry, you don't get to be flying the plane AND trying to crash it..the only reason you're making a liveable wage is because you are in the TEACHERS UNION. Like there are some decisions you get to make throughout each day to soften the system's edges for kids and families, sure, but I can't stand the abolition bullshit speak. It feels sanctimonious and smarmy and delusional and gross. Like whatever dream world you're living in is just so you can see yourself in a flattering light to yourself. They are SELF-OBSESSED. It's all about their identity and being seen as righteous. It's pretty easy to become that way when you're not doing any real work.\n\nSWers turn off their walkies when they are having meetings (mostly gossiping about evil teachers or administration)...like when a teacher is calling for help because a student is having a violent outburst.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me the most is when they talk about how school social workers should do more PD for teachers. In my mind, if you've never done a job and never could do it, how can you explain to someone else how they should be doing it better?\n\nOkay rant over. WHEW.",

(In person and online option) We have 5 board members but only 2 of us are active. The others have never volunteered in the school at all. They won\u2019t even respond to our group chat. \n\nWe are trying to plan an off-site auction. Been asking for help for the last 2 months. Have posted on social, sent emails, and sent hard copies home. We decided to do a luau theme for the auction and 8th grade grad party. The reasoning is, it\u2019s always been that theme, we have left over decorations in storage and whatever we purchase can be used for both events to save money.  Districts stance is that it is ok as long as people don\u2019t wear leis. \n\nI posted our March newsletter, the 3rd month this info is going out- and a few parents are big mad at the theme. They don\u2019t have time to come to meetings or shoot us an email but feel we aren\u2019t doing enough to communicate or giving them enough of an opportunity for input. \n\nI can\u2019t believe you guys deal with this crap on the daily. I\u2019m just a mom and a volunteer that has put in a good 500 hours of my time this year so far. Why is it the ones that can\u2019t be bothered complain the most? As the complaints started rolling in today, I responded back saying all feedback and solutions are welcomed but was blasted for not giving alternatives for them to discuss in a fb thread. \n\nIt seriously boggles my mind.",

Most of the kids know more than I do. I'm ok with social studies and American history and reading. I can teach the kids things about history easily. Also read at a very high level. But sometimes I feel so ineffective. My long term goal is to earn a master's in guidance counselling, I very much enjoy being there for students who seek guidance and direction. But my discipline is extremely ineffective no matter how stern I am. I supervise detentions at the end of the day and I do my best to instill disciplinary actions within the room while also being an active role model as much as possible. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong though. I scratch my head everytime I look at a math problem and science lab assignment and waste more time in the class just staring at the computer screen while the kids are just staring off in space. Plus the bullying is ridiculous. It overstimulates me and 8th grade girls bring my blood to a boil. I'm new to all of this. How do you deal with all of this effectively?",

However I feel bad, because they trained me on their IEP system and the other teachers have helped me out with some of the adjustments I\u2019ve had to make being in this district. And no one has any idea how unhappy I\u2019ve been because I don\u2019t display that at work.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m blindsiding the teachers and service providers I work with. I have quite the tricky class, and now a whole new person will have to learn the students and the school. \n\nI don\u2019t feel bad for admin\u2026I do feel bad for the people who will have to help someone new a second year in a row :/\n(Not that I required a ton of help, Im in my 4th year, but still just feeling guilty for some reason)",

I substituted for a semester before beginning the certification process. \n\nI had my first formal observation a few days ago, and it went poorly. The main issue is classroom management. How do I consistently enforce rules and boundaries? My kids are outta control sometimes and I'm not a \"mean\" person. They aren't aggressive or violent, just too talkative and off task. I can be strict, but I'm worried about being too strict. \n\nI feel unprepared. Overwhelmed. And scared I'll lose my job. Does this happen to all teachers? What do I do to gain skills and confidence? What questions do I need to ask my colleagues and mentors? \n\nPlease help me. I was told that I will most likely be at a different school in the fall because of budget cuts.",

No IEP, no 504, he just has no interest in trying.  He asked for help on something I had literally shown the entire class minutes before. I told him to try to figure out the problem. He came up to my desk 30 seconds later complaining that I wasn't helping him.  Looked him straight in the eye and told him \"I'm tired of enabling your helplessness, you need to figure this one out.\"\n\nI give kids a bunch of leeway for the first third to half of the year, but at this point they should understand what the expectations of them are, and most of them don't.  It's sad, really.  We're not doing these children any favors by lessening the expectations that we have of them, or letting them off the hook when they don't meet those expectations.",

        "title": "Being put on improvement plan first year in new district.",
        "body": "So, I\u2019m needing some advice. Today I was asked to have a last minute meeting after school with my principal. I agreed to meet with her even though I was in a rush to get home since my 70 year old father in law was watching my 3 year old and 3 month old.(babysitter had to last minute call out sick) In the meeting my principal wants to chat with me about things I observed in another classroom that I would like to implement in my classroom. I listed some things off that I liked, then she goes on to say that she is going to put me on an improvement plan. She says that she noticed when she has been in to observe my classroom, which has only been about three times, that not all of the students are engaged in learning, and I am letting too much slip by. She also goes on to compare me to the teacher that covered my maternity leave saying that she had no problems with some of the behavior students in the classroom but since I\u2019ve been back that student is starting to try to get away with stuff again. She also goes on to tell me that I didn\u2019t stay for the whole time during the morning observation of a different classroom that I, once again, never been in this classroom before so I was in there about an hour and a half and when they got up to go get a snack break, I assumed they were done with the lesson. So I went back to my classroom. Plus, it was time for me to pump anyways because I pump when my kids are at recess. Which is a whole other story. Now she never told me how long I had to stay, just that she wanted me to be there at the beginning of the lesson so I could see how the other teacher started. I even asked the teacher if she knew and she didn\u2019t. And like I said, I assumed the lesson was done when the class got up to go for snack break. \n\nNow let me backtrack with some other information that leads me to think that there\u2019s more to this. I started at this district this year in August from teaching four years at a different district. When I was offered a job at this district, I was very honest and told him that I found out I was expecting, and that I would have to be going on maternity leave in late November or early December. So I went on maternity leave for eight weeks and I\u2019ve only been back for about three weeks since then. It feels like since I\u2019ve been back I am always doing something wrong even though I\u2019m not trying to, for example, we had a late start one day and nobody told me that when we have a late start, I\u2019m actually supposed to be there 15 minutes earlier than what I thought. Also, during my first week back, I completely missed that I had after school duty because I was trying to catch up on everything else so the principal pulled me aside and told me that I missed that day and I apologize. I also had another time where I put up an innocent picture that a student drew that had no name or anything on it and she pulled me aside and said that she saw the post and basically asked me to take it down. I apologize told her I didn\u2019t realize it could cause issues and took it down right away.  I also did the wrong test for our state testing. I was doing what i always did for the same grade level at my past district because I assumed that\u2019s what they did and nobody told me otherwise. Basically, there\u2019s been a ton of instances where they just assume I know things that nobody has told me, and as a first year teacher in this district I feel like maybe there should be a better communication of these things.\n\nI feel like she is almost trying to target me and it\u2019s a little unfair to put a new teacher on an improvement plan. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know there are things I can improve on like classroom management and I am trying. But give me a little grace! She also told me to not sign my contract renewal just yet because we are going to meet tomorrow to talk about some other things because she thinks the grade I teach now isn\u2019t a good fit and that she has some other ideas. I absolutely do not want to love grade levels after spending so much of my own money on grade specific materials and I don\u2019t want to start all over again. Part of me wants to go into this meeting tomorrow and just lay it all out and push back against what she is saying or if I should just accept it for the sake of keeping the peace. I have been nothing but respectful and have always done what she has asked and did any last minute observations/meetings/whatever without complaint. I just feel like I\u2019m done bending over and ready ro start sticking up for myself a little more. Advice on what to do? Also sorry if there is typos im using talk to text!",

        "body": "Was watching the Alex Murdaugh trial today and was mentally comparing the courtroom to a high school classroom. Everyone was quiet and paying attention to the judge, the one person who ran the production. One person at a time spoke. Everyone was focused.\n\nThought about church. I used to go and felt good about that community. Everyone would listen  to and respect the preacher or reader up at the front. No one was ever yelling out (except AMEN!), acting out, or drawing attention to themselves. Usually. You get what I mean.\n\nThere's respect  for the leader/teacher/facilitator in those two situations. Respect for the teacher/leader talking and respect for THE OTHERS in the room. If someone makes it all about themself, or disrupts the speaker, or talks with someone nearby and distracts, everyone in the learning community in that moment suffers. The speaker loses focus. Everyone loses focus.\n\nThere's a reason courtrooms and churches do what they do. It makes the most sense. It's a teaching-friendly environment.\n\nIt makes no sense to expect any student to learn in many classrooms today. The teacher's talent at teaching is secondary to being a babysitter and social worker. Forget content area. Someone is always talking or disrupting. Always.\n\nI see a long game change coming to US Education. It'll probably be privatization, and this may be an unpopular opinion. IMO the schools that start centering their bragging rights on being able to say, \"we endorse  and suppost a teacher-friendly environment\" will get the best teachers. \n\nAnd by a trophic cascade effect, they will also have enhanced student learning. It takes care of itself.\n\n(This already happens in affluent areas. But it needs to be everywhere. You respect the teacher FIRST and everything good takes care of itself.)\n\nNot sure what the answer is, but I see this happening. A return to sanity. Why? Because no one wants to teach any more and at some point there's going to be a correction. Because we will always need and want to be teachers. IMO.",

This might be a long post but bear with me.\nI was a teacher for ten years and left in 2017 to take on full time military active duty orders (I joined the reserves in 2013). While on orders, I met and married my husband, had a baby and helped my husband transition out of the military and settle into a civilian life. \nLast year I was tapped for an involuntary military mobilization. These orders will end in the summer. Following that I feel like it\u2019s time to close my reserves career although I will miss the job.\nThe break from teaching came at a good time. I was feeling burnt out because I was a single woman who was a people pleaser and I felt engulfed by the job and bogged down by financial difficulties (hence joining the military for the benefits and such). In a matter of four years my life changed drastically and I feel like I have learned about setting boundaries and will not be guilted into the situations I let myself get into.\nI miss the classroom. I miss teaching high schoolers. I miss their humor and banter. I miss watching them progress and learn. I miss creating my own classroom environment. While I feel that my jobs in the military were super interesting, I do miss the immediate impact I felt I had in the classroom.\n\nOne thing to note, my husband\u2019s job landed us in Florida\u2026.so\u2026yeah. I\u2019m not into the politics there especially with education. But I feel like if I can teach and relieve some of the stress in this educational climate, I should?

They all made the point to me when they left that we should do this every single day. \n\nWe spend so much time discussing technology's benefits in the educational world. Still, we sometimes fail to remember how it all started, with a little over-the-top enthusiasm and curious minds. \n\nI left the day inspired but damn... I'm one tired social studies teacher.",

        "body": "Inspired by a comment I read on another post today--\n\nWhen you are dealing with a personal problem that affects your focus and mood, how much, if anything, do you share with your students?\n\nI teach high school, and about a month ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. I flew out to see him for a week, and in the days leading up to it my students were...not terrible, just hyper and chatty. I was giving my favorite class a rundown of lessons and procedures for their sub week, a bunch of them would not shut up, and I finally snapped and said something like, \"y'all, if a teacher takes off a full week right between winter and spring break, it's not a vacation. I do not have the emotional bandwidth to deal with this crap right now.\" They looked shocked, I felt bad and apologized right away, and they worked silently for the rest of the class.\n\nEver since, they and most of my other classes have been very conscientious and kind. They shush each other when I start talking, some kids have come up to me before class and asked if I'm feeling better, etc. I just thank them and move on--I don't want to drag them down with my depressing personal news, and I'm not a big sharer anyway.\n\nSome other teachers have advocated sharing the basics of what's going on, to remind kids that teachers are human, model healthy coping skills, and let them know that I'm not the one dying. Realistically my dad will probably die this semester, and I'm not going to be in the best frame of mind. I could maybe see myself saying something like, \"hey, I'm dealing with the death of the parent and may seem a little brusque or distracted. Please don't take it personally, and don't hesitate to ask me for what you need.\" At the same time, I only really share tidbits from my personal life with students when they're funny and/or involve my cat, and I'm not sure how much I want my students to know. I also have some exhaustingly empathetic kids who will probably write cards, etc., and that's really sweet, but Idk, something about it feels inappropriate.\n\nAnyway, where do you draw this boundary? Is it appropriate to share something of that nature with kids? Does doing so help with classroom management?",

I'm in near tears thinking I am going to lose my license and could really use the help. \n\nHere's the situation: \n\nI have two initial licenses, one from my bachelor's, and one from my post-bach. \n\n1. License in Elementary Education 1-6 (received in Jan of 2019) \n2. License in Moderate Disabilities K-8 (received in June of 2020) ( this license went hand in hand with my Master's. It was part of the program)\n\nI also just finished my Master's in Education: Concentration in Moderate Disabilities in June 2022\n\nI have been teaching for 4 years as a grade 6 elementary teacher. \n\nMy understanding going through college (info given to me by my professors and my school) was, I teach for 3 years, and receive a master's and then I apply for my professional license. I must do so within 5 years or my initial license expires\n\nI went to apply for my professional license. DESE has accepted everything, except they said I need to provide a principal's signature that I have been working under my initial license for 3 years. \n\nThe issue is, I am not working under my moderate disabilities license, because I haven't decided to go into that field yet. I wanted to stay a classroom teacher for a while. However, they will not let me get my professional license in Elementary Education 1-6 because it does not match with my Master's degree. They said I need to get 12 credits in the pedagogy and subject of Elementary Education to be able to get my professional license using that initial license. \n\nMy License expires in 9 months. There is no way I can practically complete another master's (12 credits of courses), in that time, nor am I able to afford another $12,000 dollars. \n\nIt also blows my mind that this is the scenario. I know many teachers who are not working in the subject area of their Masters because they either were happy with their classroom teacher job, or were still searching for another in their field. Many of my peers received their Masters in education with a concentration in ESL, moderate disabilities, math, psychology, etc. while their initial license is in Elementary 1-6. I guess we will all be in a similar situation. It doesn't seem possible that DESE wouldn't allow you to renew your license and get a professional license just because you didn't jump right into your Master's concentration. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help! Even if I severely misunderstood and made a mistake, clarification would be really nice if anyone has been through this or knows what I need to do.",

After finishing those 2 I had the goal of continuing my education to become certified to teach at the elementary level.

Now I'm currently waiting for University of Toronto's response for my Masters of teaching program application. \n\nMy family here has already been in talks to move to Dallas, the paper work had been started a very long time ago and now I'm hearing that it may be done as early as this summer.\n\nConsidering how my family heard that 1/2 schools rejected me already, they are preparing contingency plans to have me continue my education in America (preferably Dallas or California), or could be open to any other states that may be good for teachers education. \n\nI'm just sort of stressed at the moment thinking of it as I'm not sure how the process would work or if my certifications from Canada can transfer over to America.\n\nGenerally now am looking for a rough idea of the good universities in America for teachers education and how their transfer process work for students coming from a different country.\n\nThank you for any help",

With this in mind, I'm been wracking my brain for the pros and cons of each, specifically the content teaming, but would love to hear thoughts on interdisciplinary teaming as well.  \n\n\nPS: Yes, I know there is a whole other issue here with the way they handled trying to push the switch behind the backs of everyone else, but am trying to compartmentalize the educational pros &amp; cons of the theories with the other problems.\n\nThanks for any thoughts you may have!",

        "body": "I never considered myself someone who needs silence, in fact I hate it, but I've lately found myself overstimulated to the point of nearly crying every day this week. \n\nEveryone is always yelling, throwing something, calling my name. A kid is trying to get a hug, another one is trying to steal something from my desk. They hit each other and admin sends them back to class. They cuss me out and it's back to class because AP is busy. The teacher next door demanded a kid be sent home for saying \"chill out, cracker\" so the kid who threw a pencil at my face or the kid who called me a fat fucking bitch and said he hopes I get in a car wreck so they can have the sub that let them do whatever they wanted can come back. I begged my last class for a few minutes of quiet, being real with them, and even though only 13 kids were there that day I couldn't even get that. \n\nI have ADHD and I can't take meds for it without zoinking out. But I'm starting to wonder if I just can't teach at this point. I know I snap on kids who don't deserve it because I'm overstimulated. I'm a totally different person in the morning and the afternoon and I feel so bad because my last class isn't even that bad but I'm fighting a break down every afternoon. I'm in my 3rd year, and I know this time of year is always bad, but do the days of kids at least fucking whispering just not exist any more? When I went to school a decade ago sure we talked while the teacher was talking but we didn't scream \"man fuck you that's why your daddy's dead\" across the room in the middle of a test because a kid won't let you use their mechanical pencil. \n\nThe sad part is it isn't even that I have bad management. I've been told by multiple people that the kids are at their best behaved with me. The other teachers just put them out and let them roam the halls doing what they want, and since I don't do that (we're not allowed to, allegedly, and I won't be responsible when a kid walks out the front door during my class) it's just constant chaos. It's not that I don't build relationships. The kids and their parents like me. I've had multiple parents from last year request their younger child be placed in my class, and the kids that raise my blood pressure the most love me. I just can't keep doing this shit.",

We really hit a great groove and my classroom has been an absolute dream. \nThe other K classroom has several students with behavior issues and academic needs. The teacher is close to retirement and basically has given up. It's sort of a free for all and I honestly feel bad that she's struggling as much as she is. \nThis week I was informed that a student from her room would be moved to my room to help take some stuff off her plate. \nI happily agreed, even though I know he needs lots of support and it's hard on a kid to switch rooms and expectations so late in the year. \nThe past few days with him have been a major struggle. My class is suddenly chaos with kids showing behaviors they never did before, like ridiculous stuff they know is unacceptable. \nMy schedule is thrown off because he's constantly out of his seat, shouting, taking stuff off my desk, playing with stuff in his desk that we aren't using.... i know there's going to be a settling in period but it's just very overwhelming. \nI found myself yelling, I never yell.

My family's been through a lot in the past few months (my current principal is aware of this), and I'd like to have a baby in the next few years, so being close to my family would be ideal. A position for next year has opened in my hometown district. I started my career in my hometown district as a long-term sub, subbing for the teacher who is now retiring.\n\nI have really strong letters of recommendation and references from my department chair and my special education co-teacher at my current position. Should I also ask my principal for a recommendation/reference? I think she would understand and be positive in a regular situation, BUT my department chair has just told the principal she is leaving too (and she's the only other teacher in my grade level/content area). \n\nI don't know if it would be worse to tell the principal I'm considering leaving now, when I don't even have a job lined up, or to not have her as a reference and only tell her I'm leaving if/when I have another job lined up. I don't want to leave here unless I can move close to home. I want to give myself the best shot at this job, and I also don't want to leave my principal in any worse of a lurch than she's already in if I do get this job.

So, for background knowledge, I am a student teacher and I\u2019m a little more than halfway through the program. Me, the CT and my supervisor agree that it\u2019s going very well, except in 1 aspect. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the aspect that is the most important. Student safety. As I was finishing up my lesson right before lunch, I was telling students to pick up trash from the floor, and they weren\u2019t listening so I decided to pick up trash myself. In the 10 seconds that I bent down to pick everything up, a student left the classroom without me realizing it, and some students began horse-playing and when I had the situation explained to me, I realized that someone could have gotten seriously hurt. My CT explained that I could get in a lot of trouble for that, which I was aware of. If this sounds bad, it\u2019s because it is. To clarify everything, I am on the Autism Spectrum, so when things are structured and have a schedule than I excel at the job. However, transition time is really rough, because it\u2019s completely unstructured, and so many things happen that my brain can\u2019t handle everything. So, I can see 100 percent of the things that are happening (if my eyes are on the students), but I can only process about half of it, and that causes me to miss some potentially dangerous situations. I told my supervisor about this and she wanted to try to have the CT in the room during transitioning to keep an extra pair of eyes on the students. No transition has ever gone bad when we are both in the room. When I become an actual teacher, will I be able to have someone else in the room to supervise as part of an accommodation plan? If that\u2019s not an option, what do you think I should do to have a smooth transition all on my own?",

        "body": "Today, a student was 30 minutes late for class with no pass. He has a track record of various offenses, including three suspensions in the past month, and is often late for class. Usually, a kid opens the door for him, and he'll walk in with no pass and cause a disruption if I question him about it. Today, I was near the door and refused to let him in without a pass. He said he was testing. I told him to go to the person and get a pass. He said it was a sub, which made no sense. A minute later, a discipline monitor unlocked my door, escorted him into my room, and told me he was testing. \n\nAs I was leaving the parking lot after school, a teacher stopped me and asked if this student came to class. She said he was in her room. I asked if he was testing. I assumed that she would say yes. Problem solved. She said he wasn't. He was there for reasons that aren't clear. Keep in mind that he's not a student in her class. The discipline guy flat lied to me, and the kid knows this. This kind of shit is annoying.",

Our principal asked for some people to volunteer, but if not enough volunteer by Monday, they are starting cuts based on licensure area. If someone volunteers/quits/retires from a needed area, that doesn't count as a \"cut\" position either in terms of budgeting\n\nI'm not even sure I want to work at a school that's even more understaffed than we currently are. I'm teaching math to like, 43% of the junior class and i come home every day with a migraine. \n\nSupposedly, this is due to a cut in funding from the state.",

My 5th graders, who are CONSTANTLY asking to play games, did very poorly. They were CONSTANTLY, talking, arguing, touching each other, moving from their areas, and somehow they expected to play the SINGING game without actually singing.

        "body": "Hey fellow teachers.  I\u2019ve had an interesting career path.  I went to college for fashion/costume design and my first job out of college was teaching high school fashion design.  I genuinely liked it.  I was good at the art of education so I was told often I would be good at administration.  \n\nI got my masters in educational administration and was hired as a VP at 29.  This was a mistake.  I hated that role (I did meet my husband there so it wasn\u2019t a total loss), I tried moving into an admin of visual and performing arts position in another district and hated that as well.  I constantly had to fight for the little budget I had against other admin who saw arts and career classes as a joke/waste of time.  I always did costume design as a side gig so when I found a position at a college as a costume/fashion design professor but it was almost a 50% pay cut.  The benefits of that role were I have from may to end of august off where I do lots of freelance design work, as well as not having to go to campus everyday.  No observations, no lesson plans, no duties.  My boss generally stays off my butt.  I also made an educational YouTube channel that I make about $3k/yr from and I help way more teachers than I ever did as an admin.\n\nThe drawbacks are the pay is awful (53k with no raise in 4 years, with all my side work I generally pull in about 76k), the maternity benefits are terrible, there is no pension or retirement benefits.  I also get the bad feeling our fashion program is going to be killed soon, our enrollment is terrible and it\u2019s constantly made out to be our fault while the admissions team does nothing.  I\u2019m honestly surprised the school is still in business.\n\nLast year I finished my comprehensive family and consumer science cert.  Its a very desirable cert in my state, meaning you can teach fashion, foods, financial lit, culinary, interior design.  I interviewed for a maternity coverage that goes from the end of my college school year to the end of the public school year and it pays $350/day which is way better money then I make sewing 8 hrs a day or even costuming shows.  \n\nDuring the interview, the school mentioned they have an opening for next year and would be interested in bringing me on next year.  I would be teaching fashion merchandising, interior design, a culinary class and possibly two financial literacy classes but the supervisor said there is flexibility and given my strength is in fashion she would put me in as many fashion classes as possible (I don\u2019t love the idea of essentially having 4 different preps, that\u2019s a shit ton of work making materials).\n\nPros of going back: this district is the 7th highest paying in our state and I would be making about 90k, I would be back in the pension system, better maternity benefits since I plan on having kids within the next 3 years.  30 min commute, vs my current 70 min commute.  The school is also in the top 25 out of 300 schools in our state for staff satisfaction.  I\u2019ve done research into the district and their FCS programming is top notch, they have a lot grants and funding and it doesn\u2019t seem like the department is an after thought or a box that needs to be checked to graduation.\n\nBut then I read posts here.  About how people would go to any other career if they could.  I tried designing professionally and that profession has the same wage equity issues as education, honestly it\u2019s worse.  I like the flexibility of being a college professor but the pay and the benefits are awful.  No raise in 4 years (with no sign of getting one as we are in a pay freeze) is not sustainable.  I can\u2019t have a baby and keep running around doing all these side gigs, I think the more regular schedule will work better, atleast for the next phase of my life.  I\u2019ve only gotta put another 13 years in to qualify for my pension and then I could try to apply to another college position if I wished (it might honestly be a smart move because most positions come with free tuition for your children)\u2026.or do I look at going a completely different direction??\n\nWhat would you do if you were me?",

        "body": "Hello All.\n\nI work with four-year-olds. Today, one of the parents in my class voiced a concern that her son has been having nightmares about a classmate (let's call him student N) who had been out of control for the past few months.\n\nStudent N has been having a difficult time managing his behaviors in class and most of it is attention-seeking behavior. Student N would: **scream, run around the classroom, jump on his friends during nap time, act defiant when told to have a time out, and sometimes try to hurt the teacher, also saying \" YOU STOP\" back at the teacher, yesterday he pulled a chair away causing a girl in my class to fall. He even was not fazed when we had one parent read a story during parent story reading time.**\n\nI and my team would always give feedback to his parents, there has been no change in his behavior and it is getting worse. I have tried to talk to him both in a firm and calm way, I am feeling frustrated it is disrupting the class and affecting other kids.\n\nI have tried ignoring Student N, but If I do, he tries to get a reaction from his classmates by bothering them.\n\nI am frustrated, I don't know what to do anymore.",

The kid who was stabbed three times died.\n\n\"During a press conference held by the police chief and school superintendent, a hand full of students and **parents complained that not enough is being done to handle the escalating problems at the school.** \"\n\nA couple of weeks ago at another \"good school\" in my area, [two masked people entered a classroom](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/parents-faculty-at-casa-grande-outraged-over-response-to-classroom-assault/) to target a student. Teachers and students had no idea who the masked people were. The masked people turned out to be students and there were no injuries but, \"**Community members have since taken to social media to decry what they characterized as a chronic lack of proper communication or adherence to established school safety protocols**.\" There was no lockdown and parents were outraged at the lack of response and lack of consequences leading up to the escalating incident. \"administrators working at the school guessed right away that the assault on the student was conducted by the **same fellow students involved in the fight the day before**.\" They then blamed TEACHERS for what happened, saying, \"In two meetings since (the assault), Casa administration **shifted blame to teachers for not issuing bathroom passes correctly**, **not taking attendance correctly, and not being able to tell when a student is lying about having a phone with them or not**,' a group of parents, teachers and other community members stated in a message posted to Facebook last Friday.\"\n\nCurious if any blame will go on the teachers for the death of the student. Hopefully not. But it's refreshing to see that at least the parents in this county are getting fed up and focusing on admin. I read many comments from parents that are complaining about the heavy reliance on restorative justice with zero consequences.",

Admin walks in and tell's me \"please do not be on your phone during work\" in front of the class. I say no problem sorry about that, and move on with my day, walking around assisting students when they need help. I get a phone call the next morning stating that today and tomorrow the school cancelled on me. I sent an email to my boss later that day concerning pay (in my contract it says I get paid even if they cancel) and my boss calls me to tell the reason it was called off. Apparently they didn't see a good fit for me at that school because I \"was on my phone\". My boss asked me if this was accurate and I said no, I stay off my phone most of the day and explained to them what happened. Luckily my boss is on my side and said it was strange as well, and it wasn't the first time this issue has occured with subs. You know, if it was a recurring thing it would be more understandable, but I can't seem to wrap my head around how unprofessional this feels. I really thought nothing of it, the kids did the work, classroom wasn't a mess or too loud. I'm a responsible adult, I feel I am capable of texting loved ones or reading a book if there is free time (and trust me, there's a good chunk of that). Am I expected to stare at the wall and watch the sunlight slowly wrap around the classroom as the day goes on? There is only so much help you can provide as a sub after a walk around.",

        "body": "MONTHS ago, I had an incident where I was walking into one of the classes I teach (out of 10) and as I was walking in, I received an upsetting message about a family member getting ill. Class was chaotic (as it usually becomes in the 5 min interval between one teacher leaving and the other coming in). I began to try to get the kids settled and as I was doing so, my voice cracked and I left the classroom to go compose myself in the bathroom. I was back in 3 minutes. We didn\u2019t talk about it. Said family member passed away last week and I had to take a week off. I don\u2019t think they realize the cause of why I almost cried that day or that I\u2019ve lost the most important person in my life. They\u2019re also kids. So I\u2019m trying to find it in me to not be upset by this. But ever since this incident happened months ago, they\u2019ve been parading around school telling all of the other classes that they, \u201cmade me cry\u201d like it\u2019s some sort of badge of honor. I regularly get students from other classes TO THIS DAY asking me about how this one class are saying they made me cry in class. I wouldn\u2019t cry cause a bunch of 12 year olds were talking and out of seat. Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t cry if they were doing a lot worse than that. Additionally, even IF, why is that something they take so much pride im when I\u2019m this good to them? I know kids are ungrateful and I shouldn\u2019t be feeling too strongly about this but I\u2019ve tried to ignore this for too long. Given the very recent death of the person who was *actually* behind me getting emotional, this is becoming more intolerable and annoying to me the more and more other students bring it up. I\u2019m starting to think that I should give them a little 10 minute lecture on humility. What do you think? I know no reaction is the best reaction but the more this weird pride they have with thinking they made me cry, the more petty I get.",

They fed off of each other, pushing each other with laughs and smiles as they would haul out their phones and scroll while I told them to stop, ignoring me until I started texting Security to come and get them. #1 got suspended for it for two days, but it didn't change much. I didn't care -they were/are going to fail this required class anyways- but I'm not going to allow two kids to violate rules and set a precedent.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I told #2 to put her phone away. She dared me to call Security, then put her phone away - then pulled out a SECOND phone to continue. I dealt with that one, then called the parents. Parents didn't KNOW bout either of the phones, said they would deal with it.\n\n\\#2 stepped up the bullshit. Both girls would hold their phones in their laps, then act as if I were doing something unseemly if I noticed that their crotches were glowing and audibly vibrating. That bullshit doesn't WORK in my class. #2 loudly insisted that I stop looking at her and STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO HER, just let her do whatever she wanted, basically. I explained that that wasn't going to happen.\n\nYesterday, my principal came to me. #2 had gone to him and said \n\n\\-that I was looking at their laps and no man should ever be so rude,\n\n\\-that it was too difficult to follow my class because I insisted on using 'big words' and asking for feedback on the material, and\n\n\\-, winner winner chicken dinner, that I told the kids that THEY WOULD END UP AS PORN STARS IF THEY DIDN'T PUT AWAY THEIR PHONES.\n\n(and I have to say, that was quite a reach! I've been puzzling about THAT shit all night, and laughing about it)\n\nat which point the principal and I just laughed. I couldn't breathe for a moment. He knows me well enough to know that any HINT of such a thing would be anathema - and of course, no other kid in the class could back up her assertion.\n\nAfter I caught my breath, I told him that I was going to insist on a Dean's Action pulling her out of my class THAT DAY. He demurred and fussed and I said NO, buddy, 'principal teacher at the school', I was politely but firmly not going to let her back in, I didn't feel safe with her, I wan't going to be 'patient' about it.\n\nShe was gone by the next period and I'll warn her incoming teacher. hey, maybe it was a 'bad chemistry' thing and she can recover from her grade of 30%...\n\nLessons:\n\n1. Document externally. Emails and calls to parents were documented. \n2. Teach as if you're being audio-recorded. ALWAYS be professional. If you're going to lose it, call someone to take your class, go explode and return.\n3. If your admins know you, if you have a rep for doing things right, they can back you up. My P didn't have to ask himself if I'd do something that stupid. He's seen me in the shit and he knows I can swim.\n4. If my P HAD f'd with me, I'd have called my union rep so fast, and I have a rep with THEM as well.   I guess the most important thing is to build that reputation. Be as great as you can be for the first 2, 3 years, even though you WILL cry every night when you get home. That rep is priceless..",

Problem is I\u2019ve taken the History exam 4 times and still haven\u2019t passed which apparently is normal in MA because of how hard that specific test is, although I\u2019ve passed the Comm and lit exam I still can\u2019t get a MA license. \n\nAnyways the wife and I are moving to NC by the summer and I was wondering if I should still be applying for teaching positions even though I\u2019m not licensed in MA. I\u2019m planning on taking the praxis obviously at some point but I wasn\u2019t sure which one(s) I should take since I have passed the com lit MTEL. \n\nShould I be applying for positions? Or try to pass the exams first?",

I've always loved doing fashion colors and have had many colors of hair in the past. I just had to laugh about it because I am returning next year, I'm just becoming a bit more of myself again.

I\u2019ve taught every level at my current school, and this year I\u2019ve settled into juniors and seniors. \n\nMy seniors are currently writing an annotated bibliography in preparation for a research paper about a topic of their choice. They had a very loud, angry argument in class today when I told them a paragraph was not \u201c3-5 sentences.\u201d Grammatically, sure, it could be. But for our purposes, and for most academic writing purposes, they need to aim for like\u2026 7-10. We use Jane Schaffer writing, which is at minimum 5 sentences and 1 piece of evidence. As a department, we have always agreed to two pieces of \u201cCD\u201d or evidence, which would make the minimum 8. \n\nHowever\u2026 since some of my colleagues are\u2026 well\u2026 human\u2026 (and *lazy*) they\u2019ve only been requiring one. Not every colleague, but it\u2019s been more and more each year. And it\u2019s totally possible that a kid could have had the right combination of teachers leading up to my class. \n\nA student asked me what I was \u201con\u201d and they all googled \u201cwhat is a paragraph\u201d in order to prove me wrong. I have good relationships with my students and we are pretty casual, so it turned into more of a discussion about writing purposes and modes, which was productive, but they\u2019re learning about this 2 months before graduation! \n\nI love my job.

Upon further research, this \u201cschool\u201d is advertised as \u201cNo teachers, no homework, no problem!\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve followed their Instagram page and instead of learning about math and reading, they are teaching the students how to pick up garbage on the side of the road and going to museums.\n\nActon Academy does not have any state certified teachers, they have \u201cguides\u201d. They do not have desks, they sit on the floor. They have children arguing politics as a way of learning. They are also a franchised company.\n\nOver the course of a year and a half, my son has been attending this school and is so far behind. He cannot read and cannot write. As a concerned father, my weekends are spent reading to him and sounding out words. He gets so frustrated and says \u201cDaddy, you know I can\u2019t read!\u201d At this school, he\u2019s allowed to miss an unlimited amount of days, I\u2019ve had him for weeks while his mother leaves for trips around the world. I suspect she loves this school so much because it gives her the ability to leave and not worry about truancy.\n\nI\u2019ve begged and pleaded with his mother that he should be enrolled in public school, to which she has disagreed with me. She has advised me that according to the school, I, as the father, am the problem. They\u2019ve advised her that he regresses in his learning when he\u2019s staying with me.\n\nI doubled down and went to Sylven Learning to have my son evaluated. They advised me he is reading and writing at a Pre-K level. The Sylven staff agree this school is holding him back.\n\nI let her know about the results and she did not want to hear it. She said that the school is having a parent \u201cguide\u201d meeting today. The school is two hours away, I\u2019m going to show up.\n\nWhat are some questions I can ask about this \u201cschool\u201d ? What are my options with a child in the state of Florida who is so far behind and with a parent who could care less?",

I just wanted to see if anyone knows if substitute hires are subject to drug testing like full-time teacher hires, so I can plan my medication + speak to my doctors accordingly. It seems it varies district by district, and not much is clearly posted. Any help is appreciated, thanks!",

        "title": "Decaying Educational System: not parents and admin: it\u2019s a social problem.",
        "body": "I often hear that bad parenting or admins are the problem with the \u201cdecay\u201d of education. But I think that\u2019s wrong. \n\nFirst off, we have to define what we mean by the decay of public Ed. I assume by that we mean worsening behaviors, grade and graduation inflation coupled with stagnant reading and math scores, and declining civic and scientific knowledge, underfunded schools with exceedingly high needs, and increasingly powerless teachers and admin coupled with increasingly powerful parent and political influences.\n\nIf we agree on the decay above, that\u2019s not on parents and admin. Bad parenting has always been here, but the problem is 1. Schools are increasingly expected to not only fix bad parenting, but ALL social problems (eg poverty, violence, medical issues, etc) while 2. having no real power, ability, or even mission to do that.\n\nBut that still doesn\u2019t get to the root of the decay. I think it\u2019s Threefold: 1. Corporate domination has created vast inequality with a weak safety net. So while social problems such as poverty increase as a result, schools have become the de facto safety net for families. They are not primarily educational centers as much as they are a safe place to put your kid for 8 hours while both parents work just to barely get by.\n\nThen there is 2. The political attempt to privatize\u2014the No Child Left Behind era, where state testing mandates have severely hurt curriculum and scared schools. This has also further demonized teachers as the problem for struggling students (when the problems really lie in inequality and poverty) who need to be held accountable at all costs.\n\nLast but not least, 3: Constructivism. The push for more and more \u201cstudent centered learning\u201d in an environment of little accountability, damaged reading ability (because of points 1 and 2) is a recipe for disaster. Additionally constructivism, while well intended, has been a war on knowledge. Kids don\u2019t need to know anything\u2014because that\u2019s \u201crote memorization\u201d and not stimulating enough. Instead it\u2019s all about \u201cskills\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d for everyone, regardless of what they know. And if students struggle because of points 1 and 2? Then the teacher must differentiate for them all and incorporate that for an amazing, student led lesson where the teacher becomes the \u201cguide on the side\u201d. What it really means is chaos and no learning.\n\nYou could add a 4th, but I\u2019d put it in with #1. This would be inequality rising from racism and discrimination. But I think corporate domination exacerbates this and schools are required to provide token solutions: \u201cculturally responsive curriculum\u201d or more \u201cequitable\u201d grading systems. We could also throw in here Special Needs: just put them all in the gen Ed class (the least restrictive environment) and let the Teacher figure it out..",

Last year, I asked for support from my principal for a difficult class that I had, did not get much support except on \u201ckeep doing what you are doing.\u201d I went to my school\u2019s association to get more support and reported my principal due to lack of guidance and observation. A month later, I was put on a plan due to not being able to manage my class well and to get another adult to support my classroom. I did not mind being put on a plan. It is what it is. I wanted help. Everyone told me that it was not me and that my students were difficult to manage.\nThe class was still difficult to manage even with support in the classroom and I followed my plan. I was then informed that I would have to be moved to third grade due to teachers leaving or retiring. I believe this was bitterness from the principal. I asked if I had a choice and they said no. \nThis school year, I continued to follow my plan and learn the new curriculum the best I could.\nI had a meeting last week stating that my admin was not impressed with my work in third grade and I would not be receiving a contract for the next school year. They gave me the option to be non renewed or resign. \nI personally feel that my principal held a grudge that I went to the association about her and found little things to say I am not an effective educator. (Missing repeating the I can statement, small group plans needing to be more detailed and not using the literacy coach enough) \nThe association\u2019s rep told me that I will not be hired work for another school in WI if I have a non renewal. Is this true?\nOr they say if I resign, they will write a LOR and I can say I left on my own terms. I feel that HR is not my friend here and they just don\u2019t want me to file for unemployment. \nAny input? \nI do not want to work for this district anymore but I am still thinking about wanting to stay in education. \nThoughts?",

My altered mind thought that the screen was like an endless void trying to suck my soul out of my body.\n\nAn infinite sense of gratitude filled me when I looked at the friends I was tripping with, letting me know that it was important to focus on quality time with the actual people in my life. I was in pure awe of the natural beauty of my direct surroundings, which led me to the realization that I had a severe phone addiction and was wasting my life away scrolling on it. Most social media apps are now off of it, and the screen has been set to black and white to make it feel more like a tool rather than a plaything. I also now try to listen to audiobooks in lieu of scrolling aimlessly.\n\nAs more states decriminalize these substances, will increased access help reform tomorrow's adults away from their dysfunctional tech addictions and restore their willingness to learn new things and work together, or will psychedelics just send them spiralling and wreak even more havoc?",

        "body": "During our morning meeting one of my coworker\u2019s became really upset when we started talking about safety issues going on in our school. One of those issues she brought up was racism. This meeting is early in the morning, so we started talking about different levels of \u201csafety\u201d issues including racism among our students. Which is not ok at all. However, she took this as us \u201cdisregarding her\u201d basically saying that because she\u2019s Mexican and we are white passing, we were \u201cdoing it to her (being racist and not checking our privilege) by not simply staying on this subject of racism being an issue ONLY. I admit that my group members AT FIRST starting mentioning SAFETY after she said the words \u201cracism\u201d. But I think they were trying to incorporate racism being a safety issue, along with other issues since we were given only a few minutes to discuss. Long story short, my coworker stormed out of the room crying, and when she came back she basically said we had dismissed her concerns about racism, because she is Hispanic. and myself and the two others in the group were white. So, that if we are doing that to her, she\u2019s a teacher and was disturbed by how we may react to our students discussing this issue. While I did apologize, and let her know that I personally wasn\u2019t dismissing this discussion about racism, I felt that her reaction was really out of left field. Am I in the wrong here? It was a 7:00am meeting, and I think we were just trying to discuss several issues at once. Not trying to dismiss one certain issue, this one being racism. I would never intentionally dismiss a student or colleague dealing with racism. I also know this coworker and have a friendship with her, so I was kind of thrown off that she would even think of me being ignorant to racism. I was left feeling confused, and a little upset myself because I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. However this coworker made me feel horrible. Other teachers were looking over, shaking their heads at our table group as if we\u2019d said a racial slur to her. Any advice? I honestly avoid going to these morning meetings because I feel like they are toxic, the vibe is always negative. I usually have a doctors appointment or some excuse to miss these. I don\u2019t feel like anything productive actually gets accomplished in these meetings. In this case, I felt like we were trying to begin this discussion and before it began she stormed out. I feel terrible that my coworker felt this way, but I really don\u2019t believe I ignored her discussion about racism being an issue. I felt her reaction was a bit unfair, and she stormed out before hearing everyone speak on how racism is part of the many safety issues at the school. If students don\u2019t feel safe being who they are, and feel prejudice that is a huge safety issue. Maybe regarding this as a safety issue bothered her?",

Today for example, we were going out for recess and she told a student to get his coat because she didn\u2019t know how warm it was outside, and then I told him he\u2019s probably fine with his hoodie because I was just outside and it was warm, so when we get back to the classroom she absolutely scolds me and says I\u2019m being completely disrespectful to her and her classroom and tying to undermine her. I\u2019m just not sure if anyone has had similar experiences or what I should do about this.",

But this time of year my students have forgotten or gotten lazy with a lot of our expectations. After a bad last couple of days back from a 5 day snow day weekend, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to be intervening and spending the next few days reteaching expectations of behavior and procedures. \n\nI\u2019m also noticing, however, that a commanding authoritative voice does NOT come naturally to me. I was raised in a family of loving softies and I\u2019ve never been screamed at by a family member once in my life. What happens more often than not lately when facing student confrontation is I freeze in the spotlight. I have a few particularly disrespectful, and blurt-y students scattered in my classes and it occasionally gets to a point in the day when it\u2019s 3pm after a day of inside recess, I\u2019m overstimulated, I\u2019ve given warning after warning, they\u2019re escalating in their behavior, and suddenly I don\u2019t know what to say. Partially because I feel the weight of potential parent confrontation.\n\nI have no \u201cstored memory bank\u201d so to speak of phrases I can use to firmly, and sometimes harshly, speak to my students when I need them to be serious or hear in my voice how I feel. I\u2019m working on confrontation and I need your help. It sounds ridiculous, but could you give me a few go-to lines or phrases to practice in the mirror or in the car to kind of work on making that \u201cteacher voice\u201d come naturally? Like a boxer practicing technique in the gym, they say you can train yourself in what to say in the moment of confrontation. What do you say/do on the regular to let your students know you are pissed off?\n\nTl;dr please model for me what you say in conflict with a disrespectful student in front of the class",

Apparently they need district approval to pull her from it. \n\nI\u2019ve contacted everyone in the district, including the superintendent. It seems to be a huge hassle getting her out and I regret ever putting her in the program. \n\nI\u2019m at the point where I have not sent her to Spanish period, I either pick her up early or take her in late depending on which half of the day she has Spanish. \n\nI can say she\u2019s been better since I\u2019ve been doing this. I\u2019ve had her doing math on zearn and have been working on her times tables when I take her out of Spanish. \n\nThe school obviously doesn\u2019t support my approach so she\u2019s missing out on science. \n\nI\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m looking into online or private schools. Online is not ideal given the social aspect but my daughter is onboard with doing it this year and hopefully by next year everything will be sorted out with Spanish immersion. \n\nTonight I looked into Pearson online school. \n\n I refuse to send her back to the class but the school is unwilling to remove her. \n\nI think the fact that my daughter is willing to leave all her friends and even willing to switch schools speaks volumes about how bad it\u2019s impacting her. The school doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend. They only care that her test scores are good and she\u2019s passing the class.\n\nAnyone have any advice for what I can do?",

        "body": "Hello, everyone!\n\nAgainst all the advices, I've started my carrer as a teacher! I am very happy, and very eager, but I am facing a huge problem, right from the get go.\n\nI teach at a middle size school. For reasons, the smaller children (age 6 to ~12) are in a different building, and the classrooms do not have a lot of students; the biggest have 15 children. \n\nAnyways, there is only a single black girl there, on the 1st Grade. Now, I've read and knew how black children don't feel represented (even though they can't express this feeling), and it was expected... But it was HEART BREAKING to see it first hand. She was learning about different places and people, and in the exercise that followed she should circle a picture of someone that looked like her. She just could not bring herself to circle a black woman. I've tried to guide her, so she would see an identity, but there are journeys only she could (and will) face, and I will not force a path onto her. In the end, I told her to do it as homework, with mommy and daddy.\n\nBut there are times where I must act then e there. The 1st Grade girls were comparing their hair, as girls do, and they pointed out that the little black girl had curly hair, and how it was a \"bad hair\" and hard to comb, and what not. I took action there, saying that she had a beautiful and luscious hair, with sweet little curls -- so on, and so on. I did not scold them, just pointed out, and they all ended up all agreeing. Neither the black girl nor her classmates noticed what I've noticed. Today it was OK, but it _will_ happen again, and I maybe not be as well equiped to deal with it.\n\nFor the teachers, and all educators: how you deal with this? With small children with no concept of racism, that say things that perpetuate structural racism? How you teach it, without being aggressive, but making your point stand?\n\nThank you!!!\n\n\nOBS: I am not from the USA (or any other \"First World Country\", for that matter), so, if there is anything that need clarification or seemed off, please, do ask about it!\n\n^Thank you again!",

        "body": "As a high school student, I stopped saying the pledge. I knew my right and I exercised it without issue. I sat quietly. \n\nI started teaching at a school where the entire student body rose and said the pledge in unison in the auditorium every morning. I thought this was weird for a while, but I grew to love the ritual over the years. It was the only thing we did all together, in unison. Kids could opt out of saying it, but they could not disrupt or be\ndisrespectful in any way during the pledge or they would have lunch detention that day. This was a high poverty school where we had daily fights and eloping kids and all kinds of stress and challenges, but we managed to recite something all together every morning. It was beautiful in a way.\n\n I moved to a wealthier school. The first couple years I was there, the pledge was said over the speaker during announcements. Myself and only one other student in my homeroom stood and said the pledge. The other kids talked and laughed through the pledge. Admin did not mind this. I gave up trying to stop the talking every day. I stood and the one kid stood and we did our thing.\n\nThis year, we completely stopped saying the pledge. There are announcements during homeroom but the bells don\u2019t ring at the correct time and sometimes the announcements are during the transition. Sometimes there aren\u2019t announcements at all. The homeroom is 5 minutes and it\u2019s never quiet enough to hear the announcements. The pledge is not in the announcements.\n\nOur state law in Pennsylvania clearly states that reciting the pledge must be part of a public school\u2019s daily routine. Students do not have to stand or say the pledge, but the school has to incorporate it into the day. I am not sure how to address this. I absolutely do not want to bring this up with my principal as this will only strain our relationship (further). Our student body and their parents lean very far left. Only a handful of families would care about the omission of the pledge. But, it\u2019s still part of our state law. And there is no opportunity anymore for us to say it as part of a daily ritual with our school community.\n\nI thought about saying the pledge by myself during homeroom, even though there isn\u2019t a school-wide ritual. The one kid who used to say it with me graduated. I am not sure if any other kids care. They don\u2019t want to be the odd one out or the nerd. I don\u2019t either, but I am the adult. I feel like I ought to have the strength of character to follow the state law and to help our school follow the law. \n\nAnyone experienced this? Ideas for how to move forward on this front?",

I have a 9th grade student who almost certainly used ChatGPT to complete an assignment.\n\n I ran it through several AI detectors and got results ranging from 65%-77% positive for AI writing. (ZeroGPT seems to be most likely to detect AND will accept a larger excerpt than some others, FWIW). \n\nUp until now, plagiarism has been relatively easy to prove, because teenagers just aren't that good at hiding it, and I can find the source material.  However, AI leaves some wiggle room. I asked my admin if they would support treating it as plagiarism/cheating with the evidence I have - the AI detector results paired with other writing samples and lack of compliance with the required structure. So far, the response I have is \"what are other districts doing?\" So...here I am, asking.\n\nSimilarly, what are you all doing to make it harder for kids to use ChatGPT?",

Never asked to come to a conference, never got a behavior note, nothing. They have an advisory period that doubles as a kind of half assed WIN block, so hers is with the \u2018gifted\u2019 teacher. \n\nIssue: the advisory teacher calls her into the hall an asks her if she\u2019s ever been evaluated/dx with ADD. He tells her that while he is not a psychologist, she has traits in common with other \u201cneurodivergent smart kids\u201d and so he wonders if she has ADD too. He says she should mention getting evaluated to her parents.\n\nSo\u2026this is weird right?? I understand he was coming from a place of niceness but\u2026.WTF? Is this something you say directly to a child without ever mentioning it to the parents??? What would you do if this was your kid?",

Then my student and the gym teacher we\u2019re arguing and so I looked at them both and said that they needed to apologize to each other, however, it was just the gym teacher that needed to apologize to the student.

        "body": "    I\u2019m in an American History class at my university and it\u2019s online, with a professor that piles a lot of information into each exam. Suuuuuuper dense textbook. He gives us a study guide to fill out to help us along with the reading, and the test is comprised off of information from the study guides. \n\n  Unfortunately, while most of the answers are pretty clear in the book, the professor did not post anything that would help double check the work, which frustrated me personally. Also, each study guide that is relevant to the exams adds up to roughly 180 terms, each with long definitions and answers. \n\n   Me, not wanting to have to put excessive effort into creating a Quizlet for the exam, as well as wanting to double check my study guide answers, looked for and found a Quizlet account of a prior student in the class with each Units study guides already put together. I used it to double check my study guide answers and then study for the exam. \n\n   Apparently, about half of the class failed the exam, with another quarter getting below a B- (it\u2019s a rough exam). Its ridiculous to me that people should have to struggle and fail on a course when resources are readily available to help them with studying and comprehension. \n\n   Thus, the reason for my question. I group emailed my class and let them know that if they needed an extra bit of help studying, I could sent them a Quizlet for the next units study guide to help them double check their own answers. I tried to make it very clear that I was not encouraging them to use it to cheat, but I\u2019m still worried that it counts as academic dishonesty since I didn\u2019t originally make the Quizlet set. I really don\u2019t want to get expelled over wanting to help my classmates not fail one of their required courses, since the exams make up most of the grade. \n\n   The professor is an older gentlemen and very strict, and I\u2019m more worried then I would normally be because he sent out an email today warning people that he could see them cheating over proctorio, and he\u2019s going to be monitoring and watching to punish anyone trying to cheat. \n\ntl;dr: offered to send a Quizlet that has the questions and answers of study guides to my class after finding out most of them failed the exam. The study guides aren\u2019t assignments we turn in for points, they\u2019re just outlining information we need to know on the test. I did not initially make the Quizlet because they\u2019re 180 terms each and that\u2019s a lot of effort, and im worried that since I didn\u2019t originally make the Quizlet I could get in trouble.",

On top of that I'm usually hired to treat problem behaviors for students with significant delays/disabilities and I'm usually in the SPED setting for most of my day. \n\nThat has recently changed and I am FLABBERGASTED by the behavior I am seeing in typical classrooms/public schools.... The behavior is worse than the clients Im used to seeing in the SPED classrooms. \n\nAggression, threatening eachother, telling teachers to fuck off, jumping on tables, using their phones....... I've worked in the prison system and felt more safe than I do in the public school setting. \n\nI have known for quite some time that teachers were undervalued and underpaid...but in my head this was always more of an issue with administration/other adults.

It also seems like book studies on structural racism such as Kendy's 'How to Raise an Anti-Racist' has supplanted actual educational research in importance.  I am not complaining about the content, just how it has replaced actual educational research.\n\nReferral data and expulsion data can managed in ways to slow the process down or disincentivize teachers/admin from even starting any processes.   In my experience, it used to take a long time to expel a kid unless hard drugs or weapons were involved, usually at least 25 referrals and at least a year of documented interventions.\n\nI then made the comment that I felt that some students of color were not being put in the programs they need because of optics.     At this point I made some people very uncomfortable as this was a graduate course on multicultural education, so I wasn't exactly repeating the usual education tropes.\n\nI mentioned the Coleman study to the instructor, and she had never even heard of it.

But....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a first year math high school teacher fresh out of school (24), and I've found myself in a tiny public high school in NYC. There's no emphasis on math, in fact my AP has told me several times my kids might as well have not had any math classes for the past three years. I'm the only math content specialist in the whole school. I have no one who can help me or support me, no one who knows math like I do who I can talk through lesson plans with, and on top of it all I feel like the only person in the whole school who wants my kids to learn math is me. The kids couldn't give less of a shit about passing, let alone actually learning or engaging with me. I have some really good kids, don't get me wrong, but on the whole my students don't care enough to put in any amount of effort. \n\nI went to a PD today that was awesome because it felt for a second that I had colleagues I could talk math with, which I really miss and I wish I had that all the time. But then I got so overwhelmed because I feel like all of the things that they were suggesting or recommending were entirely out of my depth, and that I have no time to take my lesson plans to a higher level because I teach 3 math classes. Plus, even if I did, the lesson would still fall flat. This is too hard and I know I should reach out and ask someone for help but I just don't know if it will help. I feel so alone and lost and like I've lost something that I love and wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. \n\nMy AP knows I'm struggling, I've told her before. I've asked for a coach for Geometry or some kind of content help but she still hasn't actually followed through. \n\nI know it might change if I go to a different school but I don't know if I have the strength to start over again.",

She was also taught by her teacher that the internal organs fall out during menstruation. \n\nWhen asked who told her this, she said that her teacher did, and even said that women explode and die after sex, like bees. Evidently, there is a lot that is wrong with all of these statements, if they were made. Our state is quite liberal with sex education, so hearing this came as a surprise.\n\nMy girlfriend was really shocked at hearing this, and asked me if talking with the teacher about these statements would be a waste of time, or upset the teacher. I cannot speak to this, as none of my teaching experience has been with K-12 children. How do you all feel about parent/guardian meetings like this?",

Even if I didn't know everything, I generally had enough memorized just from being in class that As and Bs came very easily to me. I was also very good at things like multiple choice, where if I didn't know what the answer was, I could usually identify and rule out what it wasn't, either through knowledge of what the wrong options were, or through etymology clues (i.e. if the question references the word \"thousand\" and one of the options has a word with the prefix \"kilo,\" then I'd go with that answer as my guess)\n\nWhile that was a great skill to have, I now find myself with two almost-teenagers who do not have that particular skill or thought process. While I would love to teach them how I approach tests, I also think that objectively it would be better to teach them how to learn, take notes, and study. I certainly won't neglect American testing skills, but I think it is more important in the long run for them to know how to process that information and apply that knowledge they have gained in a practical manner. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is some resources for me as a 34 year old father to learn the skills that I ultimately want to impress upon them and help them develop. Also, maybe some sort of place where I can learn how to understand modern approaches to things like Math where things are presented in a radically different way than they were when I graduated from an underfunded and not particularly progressive parochial high school back in 2007.",

I know it\u2019s technically what I want them to do because it shows they care about their students, but a lot of the questions they ask me they can also ask their kids\u2026 check their backpacks for homework, check Google classroom, read my posts on class dojo about homework, etc.\nI think I\u2019m just feeling frustrated by my workload, but seasoned teachers still dread teacher meetings too, right? How do you deal with this feeling that you are doing something wrong? Is that a silly question? .__.",

        "body": "I\u2019m a first year middle grade English teacher. I was hired this year at the school I student taught at, a school district in which I previously felt comfortable and welcomed. I was well-liked and respected during my student teaching experience, and my former mentor was happy to have me as a colleague. I won\u2019t say I\u2019m a perfect teacher, because no one is in their first year (or ever), but I try hard, build strong relationships with even my toughest students, and care deeply, even on my most difficult days, about this job. I know my content well, I\u2019m extremely passionate, and at the end of the day I\u2019m giving all that I have to give and still stay sane. \n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s been increasingly difficult to not be discouraged, anxious, and frustrated at work.\n\nIn November I experienced a sudden and traumatic loss of a very close friend. It rocked my world. To say I\u2019m the same person would be a lie \u2014 I\u2019m struggling still and don\u2019t see that ending anytime soon. Getting out of bed some days is still difficult. I contacted my admin about this and received a cold, formal response, calling me by the incorrect name. No condolences, no \u2018I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u2019 I tried to understand this. Not everyone is emotional. When I asked for time off for the funeral, I got an \u2018OK\u2019 in response. Okay, I guess.\n\nI showed up to work. I tried to be there for the kids. I, embarrassingly, cried a lot. \n\nI was called into that admin\u2019s office and scolded. Crying couldn\u2019t happen in front of students. Another teacher (who will become relevant) had come to tell her I\u2019d been crying. Okay, fair. I felt humiliated and a little deflated, but I tried to understand.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s felt like there\u2019s a huge target on my back. \n\nIt feels like every few days, I get an email to \u201cstop by\u201d this admin\u2019s office. Two girls in my study hall didn\u2019t \u201clook worried\u201d about being late. They\u2019re sweet girls who came in at the bell. Okay, I\u2019ll\u2026 scold them more firmly? I look tired. I can\u2019t sleep at night, but I\u2019ll try to look less tired. Then she starts to get tipped off by the same teacher who reported I was crying, who coincidentally covers for a class every time I\u2019m out. My rosters are slightly outdated. Is this video I\u2019m showing relevant (yes, it is, and it\u2019s been shown for years by other teachers)? And some blatant lies, too. I showed a movie I\u2019ve never even seen, apparently, while kids were on their phones. When? In what world?\n\nI know I\u2019m not perfect. I have so much to learn. But I got a Highly Effective on my first observation (done by another admin). I care so much. To be told I\u2019m not giving 100% when I\u2019m giving 100% of what I have to give is so frustrating.\n\nI guess I just wanted to vent. I\u2019m so distraught and discouraged. I used to love this job.",

I mentioned that May is both Asian American heritage month and Jewish American Heritage Month. One of my students responded by saying \"fuck the jews\". My students KNOW that I'm jewish, I've always been open to them asking me questions about jewish culture. I was a little shocked, but one of my students immediately stood up and said \"You can't say that! People used to kill jews for real! They still do!\". The student that defended me is one of the best friends of the student who made that comment, and for those of you who don't have an 8th grader in your life, standing up to your best friend for saying something shitty is HUGE. Another student joined in after that and said \"I bet you thought that was cute, you should be embarrassed. That's just sad\".\n\nI wrote the girl up, but I made admin call home. I don't think I would've been able to keep my cool if the parent tried to argue with me about the referral. I know the student is getting a consequence, so I'm just hoping it's an actual punishment and more than 2 days of detention.\n\nI took count in my other classes and around 16% of my students know what the Holocaust is, but only 6% have ever heard of antisemitism. So I won't be teaching science tomorrow. Tomorrow, they'll be learning about how hate progresses and to ignore it is to be part of it.",

School policy is they can\u2019t have it on them or they get it taken up. I\u2019m pretty chill about it(pick your battles and all)so I told the class I\u2019d give everyone a free chance to silence their phones. Guess what happened not 2 minutes later. Well it happened in two locations and I couldn\u2019t pinpoint which student it was. Honestly didn\u2019t care until they did it during my lecture. I told all them to close their chrome books, and if I heard one more notification I\u2019d take up everyone\u2019s phone. Well, they messed around and found out. I assume I didn\u2019t get everyone\u2019s phone(because unless they pulled it out or I knew they had it) but I got the key suspects. Before anyone asks I didn\u2019t like, search them.

        "body": "New teacher here. I have a full time job that I\u2019ve had for three months, but otherwise I have only subbed before. I don\u2019t have a license and I have been planning on getting one, but right now I\u2019m starting to doubt that I should invest in a future in this profession.\n\nI have already decided to quit my job, because it\u2019s too emotially draining. I barely get any help from admin and admin never tells me I\u2019m doing a good job. I have a hard time handeling the special needs kids in my classes and I can\u2019t focus all my energy on keeping a few kids under control while teaching 13 others. I\u2019ve heard many times that I shouldn\u2019t take what the kids say personally, but some things just\u2026 pushes my buttons. Even when it\u2019s from 10-year olds. It\u2019s hard to hear that you\u2019re a bad teacher, mean and that you should get fired almost every single day with only negative feedback from admin. I am a sensitive person, but I\u2019m usually pretty good at holding things together at work (or so I thought). I\u2019m just tired of hearing I\u2019m terrible all day. \n\nNoteworthy is that I felt great when I subbed parttime at a different school. I felt appreciated by admin and was well-liked by students. I am also very young (22) so my age could definitly be a factor. \n\nI love teaching, I love my subject and I love working with kids, but I know it\u2019s a demanding job, and definitely not for everyone. So am I just at the wrong school or am I in the wrong profession? \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m feeling tired, under appreciated by admin and targeted by the kids, and wondering if I\u2019m too sensitive to be a teacher or just at a bad school.",

For example, I will ask them to work with students who are working just outside the door and they will loudly ask me if those students *really need* to be working outside and creates this conversation where I have to justify this request with some sort of evidence.\n\n\nI have never been spoken to before in front of others like this person speaks to me. \n\n\nThey will take me aside privately, and tell me all the things that they disagreed with that I did that day, which are normal things that I would do anywhere, like let a student use the restroom when they would have told the student no.  \n\n\nThey make decisions for the classroom and inform the students before informing me. For example, they told the students that they had to check in with them \u201cpersonally\u201d before leaving the room. \nOn Monday, I had a student ask me to use the bathroom. I said yes, the student walked out the door, and the aid blew up in anger at the student and was screaming at them for not checking in with them. This person is constantly after me for not following the rules that they have created for my own classroom. \n\n\n\nThis morning they approached me and expressed how upset they were with me at the fact that I had praised a student (who they consider to be trouble) and gave them lots of rewards for their behavior that day. I feel like I cannot do anything with my students without this person watching me and waiting to step in. \n\n\nThis person does not have any teaching experience or credentialing of any kind, but will tell other people that they have taught in my position before, just without the title or the pay (???). \n\n\nI have never had this type of interpersonal relationship problem with a coworker before and I want to make a good impression at my new school so I\u2019ve been keeping my head down about this  I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019m losing sleep and I don\u2019t want to go into my classroom because I know that this person will be passive aggressively berating me and I don\u2019t know how to correct it without looking like a monster or something. \n\n\nMy core question is, is this behavior from my classroom aid normal on any level and would I be seen as petty or an asshole if I let my administrator know that this dynamic is happening?",

        "body": "Hello and thank you to all teachers!  I'm not a teacher.  I'm a dad of a middle school teenage girl.  And this is something that has been rolling around in my head for a while, but just really started to think about it in depth recently.  AND, I'm virtually 100% certain I'm not the first or the thousandth person to probably ask this, but...\n\nAs educators, what are your true opinions on the efficacy of getting knowledge into kids' brains via Chromebooks, or via textbooks?  \n\nMy middle schooler (like millions of other kids) got a laptop the beginning of the school year after COVID started (so \\~Aug2020), and has had one ever since.  She's in 7th grade, and has had a 1:1 Chromebook last year and all of this year.  And while there are so many cool videos, interesting interactive experiences and online quizzes that have been assigned to her over the years, I just have to say, the actual \"getting information into the long-term memory part of the brain\" does not seem to be better with Chromebooks than regular textbooks.  \n\nMy daughter has moderate ADHD, and for her core \\~5 classes, each of those classes has a Google Classroom site, and within each site, there are usually 1-2 main sections where teachers post things.  And within those 1-2 sections where teachers post things, there will be anywhere between 3-5 docs or links per week posted for those classes.  \n\nYes, here comes the \"back in my day\" part, but in the late 1990s, early 2000s, we had fairly boring flows of information.  We had a textbook for each class, and we progressed through the textbook, going through various sections with homework typically consisting of \"read these pages, and answer the questions at the end of the section\".  Then after we completed all the sections within a chapter, we'd have a text or quiz.  It wasn't very 'creative', but I always knew that all the social studies information I needed would be contained in one physical place, within one tiny section of the book (with worksheets here and there).  If I was 13 today, within a 3 week period, I'd have to go to a couple places within a Google Classroom site, and then open up 10 separate links to various (cool) videos, interactive activities, online maps, etc.  I would probably think it was more interesting but...I just don't think it would be better for actually learning material.  \n\nSO, my questions to you all are, as those on the front lines of our Brave New Chromebook World....\n\n1. Are Chromebooks actually worth it?  \n2. Are they better at transferring information into the minds of students than independent reading + class discussion + answering questions on the reading?  \n3. Do you feel that various links in separate Google Classroom are sometimes too much for kids to keep up with, as opposed to having all the information always in one place (ie: a book)?  \n\nI recognize that I don't have the ability to see how things work for dozens or hundreds of kids like teachers do.  I know that for my daughter, Chromebooks do not seem to be conducive to her learning.  But, other kids may very well handle the distractions (ie: constant calling of internet web browsing distraction) and multiple info-sources issues much better than her.  \n\nThank you all for your time if you read this or answer any of these.  I'm just at a loss at what to do for my middle school daughter to help.",

And I truly believe this is because the pay is atrocious and the benefits are 9/10 times non-existant. It seldom attracts motivated educators who want to enrich the environment of the classroom/school. Instead, it attracts a mess of characters who don't take it seriously and instead look at it as a part time source of income. \n\nI'm a permanent sub for a private school, my pay is actually pretty ok compared to other subs in my area. The Per Diem rate isn't horrible but it's nothing spectacular, and because the hours are irregular it's not the most attractive position for people. Long story short, the vast majority of our per diem subs are awful. We have one man who's a great guy that everyone likes, but he's fairly old and isn't great at managing classrooms of smaller kids, so we only use him for middle and upper school. Another guy got fired recently for making inappropriate comments (including but not limited to inviting students to his super bowl party... gross). Lastly, one dude showed up for a day, slept through the classes he covered, then left halfway through leaving me with the rest of his coverages. He never came back. So now the only real subs we have are myself and the older guy.\n\nI live on Long Island, and let me tell you... there's no shortage of people looking for a job. At least my friends from college. I'm certified to teach ELA 7-12, and only one of my classmates from my major has a job as a lead teacher (excluding the ones who pursued jobs as ELL/SWD teachers). It's even harder for Social Studies and the arts. There are plenty of capable, hard working people out there who will do substitute work. But you have to pay them enough to live...",

Last week, someone said something and it was the straw that broke the camel's back.  He exploded and attacked another student.  The principle took both the attacker and the attackee(sp?) to the office.  After being told what the attacker has been through, the attackee admitted that the whole thing was his fault and he hadn't realized what his little comments were doing to the other student.  He was really mature and took full responsibility and apologized.  Que his brother... HE can only see that the attacker wasn't expelled and is furious.  He's whipping the other students up.  \n\nToday was the first day the attacker would be back in school and we were all on high alert.  The Principal waited outside for all the major players to arrive and took them all to the office the second they're all here.  They came back out really quickly, apparently she wasn't needed...The attackee's friends had already taken the initiative and apologized to the attacker and promised him that he was \"safe here.\"",

I noticed a lot of powdered makeup on the floor and asked the students who sit there to clean it up. The students refused saying that it \u201cwasn\u2019t even theirs\u201d and that the make up was too light to be theirs. I asked again and they again said that it wasn\u2019t theirs and wouldn\u2019t clean it up.

I probably shouldn\u2019t have said this part but I said \u201cidk, it looks pretty dark to me\u201d after I wiped it off the floor. I was frustrated that they weren\u2019t taking responsibility for it. Even if it wasn\u2019t theirs, it was in their work area. \n\nWhat the parents stated on the complaint twists my words into a worse statement. They reported that I wiped the makeup on the floor with the dirt and said that \u201cnow it\u2019s dark enough\u201d. I would never even think to say or do anything like that. \n\nAlso, this complaint conveniently comes after I contacted home for the student misbehaving in class and talking to me disrespectfully. \n\nI have the investigation meeting today after school.

They have belittled me, talked behind my back and made snarky comments towards me on a few occasions. It\u2019s sad because I am such a friendly and welcoming person, I can make easygoing conversation with almost anyone &amp; always make my co workers feel included. Recently they pulled me into a room and bullied me about my teaching methods and questioned my educational background (I just started at this school 3 weeks ago- prior to being here I have worked at a few different schools over the course of 7 years). They told me I was rude to students (which is false) and have no clue what I\u2019m teaching. What\u2019s funny is they interrogated me so much so you\u2019d think they were my bosses\u2026Mind you my boss hasn\u2019t said one word to me about my teaching and continuously makes me feel valued, unlike a &amp;  z. \n\nPart of me wants to leave, only because it is a bit of a distance from my house and I could find another school closer, &amp; also because I don\u2019t think I can work at a place where I don\u2019t feel welcomed and am constantly being talked down to. The last school I worked for 3 years for never had any issues with me and never once questioned my teaching methods, they only ever gave me positive or insightful feedback. The staff there went above and beyond to make everyone feel included and valued. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if these women actually dislike me or are just genuinely miserable in their own lives. (Not to sound judgmental but neither of them are the slightest bit attractive, they are well over weight and I don\u2019t think they have significant others, the one woman also walks with a limp)  \n\nAfter ranting to my boyfriend about this last night he recommended I stay and do my thing just to piss them off. \u201cIf you leave they\u2019ll get exactly what they wanted\u201d is how he felt about the situation. \n\nWhile I agree with him, I just wanted to come on here to see if I could get any insight from teachers who are dealing with this or have dealt with similar issues in the past.

I am pretty adamant about moving to Seattle as I have lived in WA for so many years prior to moving to ID due to family and really wanting to move back. \n\nHow is the job market for SpED teachers in Seattle area? There seem to be little jobs posted so far and I am not sure if it's WA thing that they start posting jobs for 23-24 school year later on as I see many popping up for Idaho already. I have a zoom interview with Renton SD when I applied to their SpED candidate pool. I will essentially have to be under 'conditional' licensure what WA education board calls it as I still have about a year and half left to finish my master's. Does that change how I get paid? I do have my bachelor's but it's not education related and cannot be fully licensed till I finish my master's.

Other teachers have complained that students arrive late and even the hod has said more than once that it's wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, when I tried to have this conversation with the teacher, she said that that's the nature of the subject, that food lessons always overrun, that the recipes must be challenging and that there's nothing that can be done about it.\n\nThis sort of answer really brothers me. Especially because this situation causes an increase of my workload. When the students can't finish on time, they don't manage to do the washing up or to tidy up obviously, therefore I find myself with a lot more work to prepare for the following lessons and less time to do it.\n\nIn my opinion, this is caused by the teacher inability to manage her lessons properly and her failure to pitch her lessons to the right level.\nOn the other hand, I'm new in the business while she has over 25 year experience. \nAlso, she is the only food teacher in our school, so I don't have anyone else to ask.\n\nAnd that's why I'm here. What do you think?",

I have worked at three schools, and two of the districts had no problem filling out the form and have already turned it in. I worked at one small charter school for a year (back in 2010), and they are refusing to fill it out. No one working there now worked there back then (it was an awful place to work), so since they have no HR and they have no one who personally knows me, they said no. I asked them to check the box declining to fill out the forms, but they also said no to that because they said neither box reason fit why they were declining. Then I asked them to write a letter on the school letter head about why they were declining and they said they didn't have time to do that and wanted me to stop contacting them because they don't personally know me (and she has said since there is no HR person, she is the HR contact and won't give me anyone else's name).\n\nAny advice on what to do next? I've 10/11 years accounted for, so will that be enough? Or is there a way to force the charter school to fill out the form or officially decline? They are just as terrible to work with now as they were back then. Any advice is appreciated!",

Once upon a time, I bought that line of thinking, but after years and years... and years of living through it, I come to the conclusion that it was a big mistake in how we deal with behavioral issues.",

Distance to work, desire to use my degree, desire to teach, and yes, it DOES pay better than any state job in my area that I can get hired for. (Apparently, no one thinks a masters in education is valuable enough to pay more than 29-35k outside of education)\nWhat the actual f**k was I thinking? I'm working over my contract hours by at least 2 hours a day at the school, I'm bringing stuff home to do, I'm working during my planning (when I get it), I'm exhausted. \nI'm second-guessing literally everything, and my anxiety is through the roof now. Absolutely through the roof. As a \"new\" teacher, I've had some support with a mentor and very supportive staff and administrators. I'm very lucky there. \nI have no work/home life balance. None. \nI was at the school until 530 last night,  got there at 8am, and worked another hour and a half at home. I'm still way behind on grading, entering grades, and everything else I have to do, including writing IEPs. And I've f-ed up some paperwork, and now I'm second guessing everything I've touched all year. It is correctable but makes me look incompetent. \nAnd oh my gosh, the behaviors. It's unbelievable. \n\nThere is no union in my state. And no limits on how much we have to do. No class size caps, no SPED caps, just more and more work and duties. \n\nI feel like a failure. I talked to my dad last night,  and he was going on about how I will have a long summer break in 12 or so weeks. I said \"if I survive it\". He got pissed off and said I always talk about quitting and I've got it \"so good\" and how I just need to stop complaining and do my job. I tried to explain the work/home balance and he just said \"that's the job\" blah blah blah. \n\nMy spouse said I'll be okay, its my first year and we will survive. I carry our insurance, and we both have chronic health issues. I feel tremendous pressure because of this.  I don't know if I messed up bad enough to have a non-renewal.  I'd die of shame if I did. Contracts go out in May, I guess I will know then.  \n\nI love teaching and I love the kids. I just suck at everything else I guess",

Students stay in their assigned room all day. In practice, this means today will be very poorly attended, and a good half of my students will not come back after lunch.\n\nI am one of the lucky teachers. I am not proctoring a test. The other English teachers and I are teaching \"enrichment\" all day. We'll each have 20-some students per room. I probably should put \"teaching\" in quotation marks.\n\nWe have been kinda-sideways told that we'll be using something called IXL. I have no idea what that is - maybe sorta like Edgenuity, I think? I literally had never heard of it before yesterday. I have no clue where to find it, or how to log into it, or how to get students into it and assign them work.\n\nWe haven't been given Chromebooks because \"the students will bring their own.\" Uh, admin, you did see how we said that when we locked down last fall, and about half of them didn't?\n\nAs far as I know, there are no paper copies of any work to give them. At least, when I left campus at 3 yesterday, there was nothing.\n\nNo emails have been forthcoming with any details.\n\nSoooooo ... my current plan is to tell them, \"Get your Chromebooks out, those of you who brought them, do what homework you need to do, hit me up if you have ELAR questions, maybe I can help you with social studies too, but don't even try asking ya girl about math or science\" and then spend literally all day grading. The quarter ends next week and I have ambitions of NOT turning in my grades at the very last minute.\n\nAh, shit. I just remembered ... the room I'm displaced to has no teacher desk.\n\nAlso, note to self: grab a couple Diet Cokes on the way over to that side of the building.

        "body": "I have biweekly appointments with a mental health therapist. Normally I'm able to leave right after work and make it on time, but he's changing office locations to someplace further away, which means that I'll have to leave work earlier than usual in order to make the appointment. Unfortunately, this would involve missing my 7th period of the day.\n\nThere are definitely teachers in the building that would be willing to sub for my class (my district pays us a solid hourly rate for covering other classes), but I'm worried I'll get in trouble if I take sick time for this so regularly. Do you guys think I'd get in trouble for missing my 7th period class, two times a month?\n\nFor context: I very, very rarely take sick time other than this. And I REALLY like this therapist and would be devastated if I had to find another. Unfortunately, due to his hours I'm not able to make it fit into my planning period.",

Aside from wasting study time, additional issues have arisen.\n\n\nIt is mandatory, but naturally, some of my HS students do not want to participate, and others are terrified. Many do their dance or cheer with intentionally sluggish motions in protest. A few students are very happy to participate in the cheer.\n\n\nI've been pushing for making the cheer optional. That way, students aren't forced to do some extracurricular performance, and those doing the cheer would all be unified in having fun and presenting a good cheer. \n\n\nMy school is considering making the cheer optional, HOWEVER, they need some kind of concrete, well-sourced reason showing why students should not be forced to perform a cheer. They don't want hearsay or opinion, but something verified by a solid authority. \n\n\nThe reason they want such a source is because: \n\n\nA. This would be a change to a long-held tradition.\n\n\nB. There is strong opinion from a few in the school that every student should be enthusiastically supporting the school, and should have no problem dancing to show their school spirit (This is kind of like patriotism-on-steroids in my opinion).\n\n\nSo my question for my fellow teachers here is: Do you know of any studies or solid sources detailing the psychological damage resulting from forcing students to do a performance?",

As a young, female teacher in the US there are obviously many security threats that we deal with on a daily basis. For example, so far this year I\u2019ve been through a pretty traumatic lockdown, a student who brought a dagger to school with a list of names of people they wanted to hurt, etc. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there are things that I can realistically do so that I have less anxiety about going to work every day. I don\u2019t have anxiety about doing my job at all\u2014I more so have anxiety about my physical safety. \n\nSo far, some steps I have come up with have been: only wearing shoes I can run in on a daily basis, emailing my representatives (repeatedly), and taking self defense classes (when/if I have the extra cash). But I\u2019m wondering what other helpful tricks I may be missing. For example, would I be able to access more information on my school\u2019s threat assessment policy to read up on it? Would getting more involved in my union help? Do you feel safer with time? \n\nHopefully y\u2019all have some helpful tips other than the classic \u201cquit and leave teaching while you can\u201d. I love my job, but I don\u2019t love feeling like I might die every day while teaching 9th graders how to read and understand Shakespearean English. \n\nThank you for any ideas you may have!",

Hugging, clinging, wanting little favors and privileges. His current teacher is not putting up very well with this (or any) behaviors from him - and it's gotten better every year! But it's far from perfect. His teacher thinks we should move my son to a different school where he'd be more challenged. I am not ready to move him, so I'm contemplating leaving the school.\n\nCurrent teacher is not the first one to bring it up maybe making a change. When he was evaluated for ADHD the evaluator mentioned the fact that we work/school in the same place several times and recommended making a change.\n\nOn the other hand, I like this school a lot, we've already done 5 years of this and it's only 2 more - and I'm not likely to be able to get back into this school later if I wanted to do that. He'll move on to middle school but I have many years of a career left.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking for perspectives from parents who've made a change like this after being together at school, and how it went, or other helpful experiences.",

The sub complains that they weren\u2019t sure what to do/ they did it differently and my class was confused (they\u2019re 7-8), or that a lesson that should take 15 minutes only took them 2 and there wasn\u2019t enough material. \n\nIf I give busy work to supplement that, _and make it clear that they were supplemental_, the subs STILL COMPLAIN that it\u2019s too much work for them to finish. \n\nIdk about you, but good sub plans, plus copies, take me an hour or 2 per day to make.

        "body": "Today was pretty stressful. We had the school-wide ACT, and I got there at 6:30 am because the coordinator said to and I wanted to make sure I was completely prepared. I read through the manual a couple of times while waiting for the students to get there--I didn't want to mess up because it was my first time proctoring, and the school puts a lot of emphasis on the test.\n\nOnce I started reading the script, I had a few stumbles, but we made it to the start of the test. For me, the hardest part was writing how many questions students left blank between tests. They don't exactly leave their answer booklets in the most visible location for my eyes, but by the end, I was confident I got it all down correctly. Whenever there was at least one answer left blank, I triple checked my counting. So when a couple of students had bubbles filled in that weren't before on previous tests, I trusted that I had done my job properly and the students had broken the rules.\n\nThis is where I recognize that my inexperience made my next steps incorrect. I missed the part of the manual that said I needed to talk to the students individually and, if the answers were still filled in when they weren't supposed to be, they needed to be removed from the room. Instead, I gave an overall warning to the class that I was counting blank bubbles. When the two students still had the bubbles filled in, I told the test coordinator instead after the students had all left. I acknowledge I messed up the protocol. However, that doesn't change the fact that I am positive that the students filled in bubbles they weren't supposed to. \n\nSo, I guess the students were informed that I noticed this. I then get an email asking me \"what did you do\" and saying \"you could\u2019ve been an actual teacher and talk to me on the side but instead you do this and you do it without ANY communication. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s crazy how you teach English but you didn\u2019t know how to communicate with your own students.\" Finally, the student ended with \"I\u2019ve never experienced this ever before from any sub teacher and I\u2019m not happy with this or you.\"\n\nI realize that I did not follow the procedure, but 1) it was my first time proctoring the ACT, 2) this is my second month ever of being a teacher, 3) I'm still recovering from food poisoning from the weekend and not feeling well, and 4) I have generalized anxiety disorder. Today was hard already, but after being personally attacked through email, I had an emotional breakdown. I forwarded the email to the student's counselor and the vice principal in charge of them, but I haven't received a response on next steps. I'm dreading tomorrow, since I see that class on Wednesdays. They've been together since freshman year, so I'm sure it'll be a toxic atmosphere towards me.\n\nI really needed to rant. I was already considering not coming back to this school next school year for other reasons, but this has made up my mind.",

I subbed for 2 years before finally getting a job in January, for an older elementary grade. I was initially so excited, and so were the kids, until it was time to work. \n\nAbout two weeks into January, they quickly started giving me attitude, talking while I talk, etc. this is the rudest class I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nToday, I broke down. Full tears. I tried to let them get into small groups. Tattling, yelling, everything. I couldn\u2019t even get them to stop talking long enough to give out the directions. I was frustrated and went into like a meltdown. I didn\u2019t want to, but out of the 6 hours we have in the day for instruction, we probably only get to do about an hour because I\u2019m always having to tell them to stop talking and pay attention. \n\nIt\u2019s been 2 months, and I\u2019m so tired. I have never cried in front of a class, and when I asked them what was causing this, they essentially told me they won\u2019t/don\u2019t respect me and the only reason they listen when the principal is there is because they\u2019re afraid of her calling home. They have no motivation to behave except fear. \n\nMy question is:\n\n1) Where do I go from here? I can\u2019t have the admin there all the time to have their behavior under control. \n\n2) Should I start looking into a new school or job? I feel so defeated and I haven\u2019t even spent a whole year in ny own classroom yet. \n\nThank you in advance.\n\nETA: Our school is a \u201cpositive discipline\u201d school, so a lot of times if I send a kid to the principal, they often get sent back basically being like \u201cI won\u2019t do it again\u201d. So I have admin support, but it takes a lot for really serious consequences.",

        "body": "Obligatory I'm on mobile and English isn't my mother tongue so excuse my grammas\n\nSo, a bit of a background. I am both a sixth grade and seventh grade ESL teacher in a school where the student's main language is Spanish, and around 80% of our student body is from a low resource area. The way the school works is that every teacher has a homeroom group and the gist of it in my school is that while you may work with students from your other courses, your homeroom is basically your responsibility. This means being the first to deal with attendance, any type of intervention needed with social worker, school counselors, etc.  When it comes to my homeroom I always let them know that all their teacher communicate and keep constant tabs on their behaviors in all of their classes and when they go on their lunch break. \n\nNow, on to my dilemma. I have a student with a rather complicated homelife and I know the kid's family scrapes by and since I have taught this student's other siblings (3 so far) the student feels comfortable enough to talk to me about any sort kf problem they have. Today, during the lunch break, this student came to me asking me for a mail stamp (I don't know, a post card seal?) since they are writing a letter as an assignment in their Spanish class and part of the assigment was to get a stamp in order to be able to mail their letter as part of the assigment (keep in mind I work in a low resource school and mail stamps are only sold at the post office). I told the student I did not have a stamp with me (this is not for my class) and I told the student to just let the teacher know that they could not get their stamp and reminded them that being honest is the best policy. Before lunch break ended I let my coworker know that the student could not get the stamp. We have a habit in my school to let our coworkers know what students tell them and if they were making any comments in our classrooms about them just as a heads up (the teachers that work with me tend to do this in goodwill). This coworker thanked me for letting them know and that they would talk with the student during class. In my mind, everything was fine. So when my homeroom was going to my coworkers classroom for their class (the Spanish classroom is next to mine) my coworker calls me over in front of my student and from my perspective everything was going fine so far until my coworker basically tells the student that asking another teacher for materials for their class is basically an insult to both teachers and that the student knew about this assignment since last week. The student was basically petrified in place and wells as me. Right before I could intercept my coworker another college called me over to talk about another one of my homeroom students and I basically said nothing. I feel horrible for my student and I don't know how to approach my coworker over this since I don't want to stir up any drama but whay happened today doesn't  sit right with me. I am going to apologize to my student tomorrow, since I feel responsible for this but at the same time I also want to let my coworker know that what they did is not ok with me at all. I don't know how to approach this in an appropriate manner. Any advice?",

Normally I've had teachers want me to write in my notes if any students gave me trouble and they would handle discipline/talking to troublemakers the next day, but I can't say when this teacher will be back. \n\nThis whole situation is just kind of difficult since I barely know these kids, I can't really contact their usual teacher, and other than something being posted to google classroom once a week or so I have nothing for them *at all.* No videos to show, no worksheets to handout, nothing. The best I've been able to do is give them time to work on other classes' work or just sit doing something quietly. Overall the kids are pretty good, but sometimes I have issues with certain students being loud or distracting their neighbors who are actually trying to work and it can be difficult to get them to be quiet even for the two minutes it takes to do attendance.

Over the past year I\u2019ve had multiple subs because I\u2019m out for trainings, IEPs, etc. I haven\u2019t really taken personal days because each time I\u2019ve had a substitute, there seems to be lack of care on their part. I know students aren\u2019t going to do much work with a sub, but classroom respect seems to disappear entirely. I\u2019ve had things stolen from my room, desks are rearranged entirely, posters are torn down, or theres piles of trash. The subs primarily leave comments about how great the day was, but seeing what I come back to, it doesn\u2019t seem like it. I keep updating sub plans to mention what they should be aware of and if they can be vigilant with students. I\u2019ve left feedback for subs, but it hasn\u2019t made a difference either. I\u2019m not sure anymore what to do. It\u2019s been the primary reason why I feel like I can\u2019t even take a personal day because the chaos I come back to isn\u2019t worth it\u2026any advice I\u2019d appreciate!",

It\u2019s also a central part of the culture; families bond across generations through traditional land use practices. \n\nOur librarian keeps several hunting periodicals in rotation. These are popular and, of course, have articles about firearms. How to load your own ammo, best youth deer rifle - you get the point. This never occurred to me as a problem after growing up in a similar culture, and spending most of my career immersed in it. \n\nWe just got a new teacher from a more privileged and suburban background. She is shocked and appalled by the availability of firearm-related literature in the library. She\u2019s made it a crusade to get this material removed. Now we have a controversy. I can understand her position, but I think I disagree with it. I can also understand why she\u2019s made plenty of enemies with her forceful and nuance-free approach. \n\nWhat say you? Cool to have hunting articles on the magazine stand? Or nah. I\u2019m not seeking validation, just clarity from impartial sources.",

I say \u2018technically\u2019 because I have taught at the preschool level for many years and feel this was a huge advantage for working out my management and teaching style. \n\nMy classroom was added this year due to high enrollment and is in jeopardy of getting cut next year due to low numbers. My principal came to me and told me she wants to keep me in my role and is going to move the veteran teacher instead. She thinks I should have a chance to master this grade level instead of being tossed around. I am very excited but I think it puts me in a weird position. \n\nThe vet teacher is very outspoken and speaks against the principal A LOT. They are also reluctant to change, will not implement new strategies/curriculums, and classroom management from what I see sucks. They have a \u201cit\u2019s my classroom and no one can tell me how to run it\u201d mentality. I think these are reasons they might be moved instead of me. \n\nWord has gotten around (not from me) that they will be moved but I don\u2019t think anyone has told the vet teacher. I feel if they get moved it\u2019s going to create tension against me next year because this vet teacher is close with a lot of my coworkers. Am I being used as a pawn to piss off the vet teacher? Or is my hard work being recognized and valued enough to keep me in my position? \n\nI obviously don\u2019t have any say in this decision.

For context I live in a medium COL area and my salary is about $40k as a first-year teacher with a 2% raise every year for 10 years.\n\nThe only places that made sense cost-wise are mobile homes. So, this weekend I will be moving into a trailer park. It is in a dangerous part of the city, is by far the most run-down place I will have ever called home, and still isn't necessarily cheap. The state of the world for new teachers is so depressing. I don't care about living an extravagant lifestyle. I just want to be able to afford to live in a decent house, pay for my needs, and be able to go visit my long-distance friends once in a while. If I wasn't getting out of the profession after next year this would just be my life for a long time. I am incredibly frustrated, that's all. It's hard to be passionate about a job that doesn't care about me.\n\nAny advice for me beyond not eating avocado toast and buying Starbucks?",

The students were listening, staying quiet while I talked, participating, staying off their phones! For a high school math teacher, a dream come true! We introduced a project and had several minutes where I showed them how to do something and then they get several minutes to try it. Administrators love that shit! The two students beside my admin were working so well that they finished early and were quietly talking to each other. It was a great lesson and I was proud to end on such a good note!\n\nIn the post observation meeting, my admin tells me I need to work on my behavior management. I was dumbfounded. Everyone participated and no one interrupted the lesson. I had to ask her to clarify what I did wrong. She told me the two students that had finished their work had been talking which was distracting to her and I should not have been afraid to stop what I was doing to address it.\n\nOur class periods are 85 minutes long. I got a bad score in the behavior section because two students were quietly talking to each other after they were done. Apparently keeping students quiet for 85 minutes is what I should strive for. I wonder how the admin would handle teaching a lesson and trying to keep the class silent and engaged. Oh yeah, my admin has never taught in a public school and this is her first year as an admin. What have your admin told you that indicate they have no idea what they are talking about? Maybe that will make me feel less salty reading what y\u2019all have had to go through.",

I understand that teamwork is important, but no one I grew up with was nearly as laser-focused on athletics as these kids are, and we're socialized just fine. Honestly, we're probably socialized better because we don't talk about \"destroying\" the team from the school one city over as if being an opponent were the same as being an enemy. \n\nSports is taking them out of class and so many parents use it as an excuse for why their kid didn't do the assignment or flunked a test, and, as ridiculous as it sounds, they not only think that's a good trade off, but that we should grade more leniently for kids in sports than those who actually do study, as if the goal were the grade instead of learning the material. \n\nBut when they're in their 20s or 30s and applying for the kind of jobs almost everyone gets in offices or factories or building homes or working in stores, talking about your days in football during the interview might get you the job but it probably won't help you actually do it. That's what knowledge and learning are all about. \n\nIn a way I get it. Sports are dramatic and exciting and a lot of parents find it much easier feel proud of their kids for things they can watch them accomplish and to bond over activities they understand. But I feel like they're handicapping them when they decide sports not only matter more than the rest of school, but also that it's worth sacrificing their learning there too.",

They have had a girl transferred from the class because she was bullied and another boy with behavioral issues was also transferred. They gossip, they lie, and they collectively don\u2019t put forth the effort of my other second grade classes. If they\u2019re this bad now, they are going to be monsters in a few short years.

The classroom teacher has stopped asking \u201chow were they,\u201d because in the past I\u2019ve provided a list of things that they do and so little of it is positive.

I fought through it, wore a mask, and went in anyway, mainly because I\u2019m not prepared for a sub day 2.. bad idea. Couldn\u2019t make it through homeroom, I just felt awful and I didn\u2019t think it was fair to drag whatever bug I have around so I told my supervisor and she pulled a sub that was going to help her out today and put her in my room. \n\nI just got back home and I can\u2019t relax. I can\u2019t stop stressing about how unprepared I left things, how my kids might not have enough to do, how I disrupted the supply\u2019s plan for the day. I very rarely get sick or miss work. But when I do, I\u2019m stressed as hell about it. I keep reminding myself that everything runs whether you\u2019re there or not, people get sick and stuff happens. But it\u2019s still hard for me.",

They would send teachers/administrators on trips in the guise of learning school improvements for students. \nOur principal and vice principal traded off going on trips across the US.  Florida, Hawaii,  Las Vegas,  California,  etc. After being there for 15 years,  I asked if I could go somewhere.  I got to go to Nashville,  and when I went to the conference,  I couldn't find any of the administrators.  I found out they were playing golf. I expected to return and present to the school what I and the other travelers learned. Not a peep. Nothing was required of me, to help spread the information I learned.  Another time, a teacher was sent to a Texas conference to learn something I teach. I asked him what he learned,  he said he stayed at the hotel the entire trip. How can the administrators reward themselves with these trips, on taxpayer's dime?",

        "body": "TLDR: Admin told me to get this kid to pass however I can despite my outcry. NOW they tell me to fail him to send a message to parents that refuse SPED eval. Parents are mad and admin indicated I maybe have falsified grades to help their kid. I\u2019m worried this is going to ruin me. How can I cover myself?\n\nI need some advice. This is my 18th year teaching elementary. (Texas so no union.) This is the first time I\u2019ve had a principal micromanage my grades. A little background: one of my teammates failed 75% of her class due to missing work and she never helped them get it done. I\u2019m talking the kids\u2019 report card grades were in the 20s. Due to this the district came down on admin. (I completely understand that, and I do not agree with my teammate.) Since then admin told us in no uncertain terms are we to have missing grades in the grade book and if we fail a kid on progress reports or report cards we will have to answer to her and the district. They even pull our reports and highlight any failing grades and then holds our reports hostage until things are changed. She never tells us to change it, just lectures us on failing kids. (She also threatened us with 12 pages of documentation per failed kid and 3 conferences with different people per kid. She\u2019s a BIG bully!) \n\nNow to my issue: I have a student that is reading 2 years behind, is probably autistic and ADHD and can only succeed on first grade work. He acts like a toddler. His mom sticks her fingers in her ears when I ask for a conference or tell her about how poorly the kid is doing.  So I\u2019m not allowed to fail this kid. I\u2019ve accommodated and modified until I\u2019m blue in the face. I\u2019ve given him below level work to show what he can do. I\u2019ve worked with him one on one. He needs to be evaluated. Mom doesn\u2019t want that. So NOW my admin tells me to fail him because we need to get a point across to parents. Admin told the mom yesterday that I\u2019m padding his grades. (Yes. He gets a 50 instead of a 15 on assignments.) So he\u2019s passing for the year, barely. The mom is livid. (I understand that!) I\u2019m livid because if I had done what I wanted and known was best in the beginning mom would be aware of the seriousness and we could have had him tested. I never would have passed this kid. (Not with 20s but maybe 60s so he could recover.) I am worried admin is going to throw me under the bus for possible falsification of grades - which I didn\u2019t do but they made it sound like that to the parents. How screwed am I?",

        "body": "In my school, the subject teachers go around from class to class, and each class has its own homeroom teacher who teaches only their class, either a language module or math. In one of my classes, there is a homeroom teacher who is exceptionally disruptive to the flow of the class. She is constantly taking students from the class to do homework, ordering them around for 5 to 10 minutes into the start of my lesson, disrupting the flow of our activities when I try to get the students to move around and participate. In the middle of a lesson, she will randomly just start barking at a kid who hasn't done anything but will ignore the one who is shouting random, unintelligible noise out.\n\nI have made it very clear before that I don't appreciate her telling students to do their unfinished homework during my lesson, nor do I accept her removing students from the classroom to do it. I've asked her to allow me to conduct the lesson as the current teacher of the class, rather than her constantly interfering. All of this has fallen on deaf ears, and in fact, it seems she is doing this more in spite of me asking and then telling her to stop it. \n\nI am not sure what I can do in this situation, because the head of the language dept. refuses to see it as an issue, the vice principal refuses to do anything about any of the homeroom teachers. I have asked others who also teach this class what they do in this situation, but they all just sing her praises as if she is the best teacher there is. So, I am thinking she is either doing this *only* in my lessons since it is in the afternoon before electives, or she is purposely doing this out of spite because I asked her to not take the kids out of my lessons or let them do homework. \n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion for what I can do about this? My class is hard enough to deal with given that the student's in this particular class are not as academically excellent when compared to other classes, but this situation with the homeroom teacher is too much.",

        "body": "Okay this has stuck with me long enough. I\u2019d like to get opinions. I had a student smash my foot (didn\u2019t break thank you boots!) AND punch me in the stomach when I was a few weeks pregnant. It\u2019s actually how I found out. \n\nAdmin removed the kid for a day. But not right away. It wasn\u2019t till I hobbled up to the office on crutches a few days later and someone from the district was there. I had to beg for help as I was terrified! The kid kept threatening to smash the other foot. \n\nAnyway a few days later the same kid threw a chair and another desk. Full tantrum. Was removed by the VP and SRO. SRO asked if it was a common occurrence. VO lied and took the kid to the office. SRO stayed behind and I told them everything. They said that I should press charges and lobby to get the kid removed from my class. \n\nAdmin refused to switch them AND the kid still got field day a few weeks later!! \n\nShould I have pressed charges when I had the chance? Or would that have made me an asshole with no job?",

This is a high school social sciences role where I'll teach law and film classes. I am nervous! I have subbed daily with different classes, but only a few roles were this consistent. I am young; I just graduated college and want to become a social sciences teacher, so this is the perfect opportunity. \n\nI have spoken with some of the teachers on site who will be helping me with lesson plans and grading, so I'm not too worried about that. I am more anxious about classroom management. I want to be sure things are under control at the git-go. \n\nDo you have any advice for me about starting on the right foot? Or any general advice for me with this position? Thank you!",

What would you have done in this situation?\n\nYesterday we had a high wind sand storm that blasted through our city with winds reaching up to 60 mph. \n\nThis morning I came into work expecting the usual thing, a normal day, but found out that our electricity was out. All classes had to be put in the cafeteria or library. My class and the other music classes were put into the library and had to wait for further information. \n\nThere were rumors spreading that our middle school staff and students would be transferred to our feeder pattern high school. I thought that they wouldn't do something that ridiculous but I was wrong. \n\nParents were getting contacted by their children to pick them up from school and some parents did. I knew nothing was going to get accomplished today so I thought that was a good thing. \n\n2 and a half hours into the day all classes were transported to the nearest high school. My class and other classes were put in the theater but don't know where the several other hundred kids ended up. \n\nIt was quite annoying to just baby sit students and wait several hours of anything to happen. Eventually, we had lunch a couple of hours later with news that we will be going back to our school after eating. That didn't happen because there was another school that transferred to the high school and those students were taken back first. This added another hour of boredom to an annoying situation. \n\nWe finally went back a little past 1. Luckily, admin gave us a 30 minute lunch to give us a break. Classes  resumed at 2 with few students. I only had 5 students for the last hour and was glad we didn't do much.\n\nSo, it was just a long and annoying day due to, I think, a bad decision made by admin. Who knows when the electricity came back on at our school and I hope the rumor of the lights coming back on as soon as we left by bus to the high school is false. I feel it should have been a delayed start but the school sure does love their $$$ with high attendance.",

I count it because I taught, lesson planned, and all that jazz) all in the same town. Some city and some county. Some schools the teachers get jeans every Friday. Others get them a few times a month, some can wear them whenever. It\u2019s all up to the principal. \n\nWell this my 3rd year at this particular school. Let me set the scene: title one, no PTA, high refuge, high ESL population. I absolutely love the school. But the principal I hate for various reasons. One being their huge hatred towards jeans. With the old principal we could wear them for dress up days, random Fridays, and if we bought a Jean pass. But they never took the pass. I used the same one MULTIPLE times. Really we all did, as long as we did our job and the kids were loved and taught we could wear what we were comfy in. \n\nOur current principal hates jeans. Says they\u2019re unprofessional and make us look lazy. If we get a Jean pass for donating money to book fair or FRC they have to be used by a certain day and he has to SIGN off on it. I went on early maternity leave and he refused to extend one that I had. He has made people go home and change. This is the same principal who will make kids sit out of recess if their shoes don\u2019t have a back on them. I\u2019m sorry but most of our kids are lucky they have shoes. They wear the same pair even after they wear out or grow out of them. But I digress. \n\nWhat is your opinion about jeans? If you wear a niceish top and don\u2019t have holes in your pants are they okay? \n\nSorry for the long post. Got on my soapbox there.",

However other times my prep is less efficient because I\u2019m so tired. I go home everyday and can\u2019t bother cooking and just crash on my couch with the tv. I love my job while I\u2019m there but I can\u2019t seem to live my life. Weekends have become lazy days to recoup for the week ahead. Shopping and laundry take the energy from me for days! Does this ever go away? I was told this was a first year teacher thing and I\u2019ll be fine if I just tough it out for a few years. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what to do. My doctor isn\u2019t really helping.",

He's had no problems in class, doesn't care if we're on our phones, and allows us to listen to music during lessons. I'm pretty sure we're all passing because of how easy his class is and it's not because he rarely assigns homework, no- the stuff he teaches, he makes it so easy to learn. He makes the curriculum fun! \n\nWe do this thing where one of his dry-erase boards is just divided into three sections and at the beginning of the year, had us draw on index cards that were cut in half and that's how he knows where we are! He calls this \"leveling up\" and I can only think of it as a video game. This man has single-handly earned the respect of so many students it's insane.

        "body": "Title pretty much says it all. My school's ok and I absolutely adore my class - nothing's terrible - I just feel like a bit of an outsider.\n\nThis could just be my M.O. - just not being happy with any school - this is my 5th school in 15 years.\n\nThat said. I'm still thinking of looking at other districts. 1) Because I don't feel like I'm the right fit and 2) I want a school where the district pays my retirement instead of me.\n\nI feel like I'm not the right fit for a few reasons. \n\n* I'm all for recess. I love that we have a morning recess but most days our combined recesses (for my grade level at least) add up to over an hour. Of our little over 6 1/2 hour days, an hour recess + 20 minute lunch + 40 minute specials, leaves me with 4 1/2 hours to teach - it leaves me feeling stressed and feeling rushed to get all the stuff I need to teach crammed in. I like to pepper brain breaks in with what I teach but I feel like I'm not doing that as much this year because I have to teach at break neck speed just to get everything in.\n* There's a crapton of other events/assemblies that keep kids out of the classroom. This is another thing I love - in moderation and when it's done to enrich and not just for the heck of it. When did assemblies become such big money-making events? I took a break from teaching for a few years and when I come back every assembly we have has an order form for parents to purchase something. Honestly, it's overkill. \n* My reading block isn't protected. I don't mind the reading specialist or the SPED teacher taking groups during this time, but it's a free for all. Anybody can get my kids at any time. I just want 90 minutes where my kids are in the room to learn reading. Half of my class came to me below level - we need this time.\n* And that's another thing - the grade below me 100% didn't pull their weight. I'm all for centers and hands-on learning but knowing how to sit and be quiet during whole group time is an important skill. How are you going to learn letter sounds if you can't hear the sounds? It seems like all they did was play in the grade below. I know the teachers care about their kids but you got teach some time.\n* I'm the only one who pulls small groups every day. This boggles my mind as this was extremely commonplace everywhere else I've worked. I want to work with people who inspire me and that I learn from. I feel like I've been transported back to the 90s where all we did was worksheets and the occasional craft.\n* This might be controversial, but the mental health services have gotten out of hand. I'm all for getting your therapy on, but it's disrupting to the day. I'm fortunate my kiddos that receive help aren't behavioral problems, but it's annoying to have my reading block interrupted for this especially when a) one of the therapists doesn't even bother trying to schedule a time with me and b) I don't know how much it helps. I've always kind of believed that therapy only truly works when you want to put in the work to make things better. I don't know if many of these kids have that level of self-awareness to a) realize their effed up and b) want to get better. But the plus side is that it's a nice break for the teachers who have problem kids when they're kids are taken out for these services so I might be singing a different tune if I get a difficult kiddo next year.\n* Even the parents don't seem to care about academics. They're very involved socially and send snacks and such for the class, but the absences are outrageous (talking like 20+ days)  and I don't feel like I'm doing well at getting across the love of learning with them.\n* Very few people seem to be on their A-Game. Like I get it. Teaching can be so difficult and depending on the year - sometimes you're just in survival mode, but I've always had a strong work ethic. I can't just sit by and not teach or having kids play indefinitely. The years I have higher kids, I will do that a little bit, but when I have a lot of low babies like I do this year - my conscience won't let me be lazy. These kids need to learn how to read. I don't get the impression from many of my coworkers that they care about teaching as much as me. They don't make lesson plans. They don't do interventions. They miss work constantly. They're unprepared. I don't expect people to work after school's out - end of day GTFO, but while the kids are there? Teach, for goodness sake.\n\nI feel like such an odd duck because I don't feel like I share any of the same work values or teach in similar ways to anyone else. I'm gonna keep my head down and do my best for my class, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking of looking at my other options.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way like you don't fit/vibe with the school?",

Because I'm at her same number, while I was away last week at a conference, the other K teacher asked for a student she's been struggling with to be moved to my room. I really don't mind, the student has friends in my room and is a good kid, just gets overwhelmed and easily influenced. Given it's so late in the year and my classroom has different expectations and routines, and suggestions for a smooth transition? I've had new students, but never from just down the hall this late. I don't want them to feel like they did something wrong or feel like the kids from their other room are no longer their friend. Maybe a big welcome card from our class? A show and tell so we can get to know them better?",

I hear them talking behind my back that I'm not fun. Today one boy told me that I'm his least favourite teacher.\n\nI can be quite socially awkward and the kids seem to pick up on that. Plus the daycare is unorganised and we're understaffed which makes me very stressed. The boss (while being very nice) keeps changing plans on the day itself.\n\nI feel like I'm in way over my head most of the time, and wound up like a spring. The more I try, the less they seem to like me. Should I just care less? \n\nAre there ways to make the kids like me more?\nAny help would be appreciated.",

The same boy started making mooing noises so I said \u201cwhat did I Say?\u201d And got on my laptop to indicate I was giving him a zero, he goes \u201cI wasn\u2019t booing, I was mooing!\u201d Idiot friends were laughing uncontrollably at this and started mooing too, I said anyone who boos or moos is getting an office referral, call home, and a zero, yet ANOTHER kid started cooing and said \u201cyou said no booing or mooing, you didn\u2019t say anything about cooing.\u201d Now they\u2019re all laughing amongst themselves and making different stupid noises, it was essentially a waste of a 90 minute class. \n\nThis is the behavior of high school students, not preschool or daycare kids.

By keeping the door closed all day, their funk is circulating around the room and suffocating me.\n\n2) People are constantly at the door, either knocking on it or using the doorbell. So it's roughly every five, ten or minutes having to constantly hear the cycle of the door closing, someone knocking on the door, the door opening, closing again, knock knock, paras jiggling the door handle trying to open it etc. It's just audibly torturous.\n\n3) Doors have to be closed and locked during lunch and conference periods, too. You can't prop it open with a doorstopper. I don't want to feel trapped and contained in a room all day, I want to at least be able to open the door just a little to see the hallway.\n\nI'm at a point where I'm convinced that this isn't even about \"safety measures\", it's about making the environment feel as prison-like for teachers and students as possible",

I do not see this anywhere on the CPS website, but whenever I google the process for becoming a teacher in Chicago, I see people talking about a Teacher Quality Pool. Is this still a step for getting hired in CPS? I am confused because it is nowhere to be seen on the official websites. Has it been taken away? \n\n(Also, if anyone has any other advice, I would absolutely love to hear!! Excited to join the Chicago community.)",

Today, while writing on my white board, I realized it the bracelet was making an annoying clinking sounds against the board so I took it off and placed it on my desk for the rest of class. This was during my last class of the day.\n\nCome time for dismissal, I notice a student wearing a bracelet identical to mine. I look over and mine is no longer on my desk, so I go over and ask the student for my bracelet back. She denies it's mine and says she's had it on all day. I tell her she has one more chance before I call the VP and she gets a referral. She still refuses, my VP is right down the hall so I flag her down and tell her what's going on. She asks the student to return it, student says no. Then the student tells my VP that her mom will confirm it's hers when she picks her up. My VP says she'll walk the student down to the pick up line, and if mom says it's her she doesn't have to give it back. I said no way. Thankfully my mom had sent me a photo of the bracelet the day she picked it out for me, I had to show it to my VP and she finally made the student give it back.\n\nI know I might be nitpicking here, but I was just supposed to let a student walk out of the classroom with something that belonged to me?? No way in hell. And what if her mom had just assumed it was hers and said yes? Or lied to keep her kid out of trouble? I would have lost a gift my mom gave me. I'm sure my VP had good intentions but geez. Needless to say, no more wearing that bracelet to school.",

He brought up the moment I talked about in the last post where one girl didn\u2019t raise her hand. \n\nAnd he brought up one moment from the last formal observation where a few students came in a little late (just got back from a field trip thing), and he said they came in \u201cdistractingly\u201d and claimed that I have no procedures because of this. Well, my procedure is come in quietly and put your stuff down then come up to me to ask about what they missed. Which is what they did (except for saying \u201chi\u201d while walking past friends who were already placed in small groups). The principal said that this incident showed low student engagement and that I \u201cdidn\u2019t know my students\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crazy or if he just hates me. I\u2019m literally so full of self doubt because I\u2019m only a second year teacher and if I were to grade myself, I\u2019d say my classroom management is a B+, not a F- like he\u2019s saying\u2026.\n\n\nAnyways the meeting ended with him telling me that he will be recommending *non renewal* for me, but that he is \u201cwilling\u201d to let me resign so that it would be private. Then he gave me a name of a person to call, email, or talk to in person about any questions I might have. \n\n\nHe said he would be happy to write me a letter of recommendation and that he thinks I work really hard and that I\u2019m a great person and that maybe some other school environment would be better suited for me. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not so much hurt by the being fired because I was going to resign anyways  because I want to leave teaching (because I just don\u2019t enjoy most parts of it and it\u2019s starting to affect my mental health tbh). \n\nWhat I AM hurt by is the fact that it feels unjustified. I thought I was doing a great job. Other teachers have told me I\u2019m doing a  great job. Former teachers subbing as aides in my class have told me that my lessons are engaging and that my 7th graders seem to really like me. I still struggle with classroom management at times, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more than any other teacher here. \n\nThe last principal, who was much more respected and experienced than this one, LOVED my lessons and gave me great comments and scores on the evaluation last year. I had NO \u201cneeds improvement\u201ds, only \u201cprofiencent\u201ds and \u201coutstanding\u201ds. I just don\u2019t get it\u2026.\n\nIdk, I\u2019m just crying at home now feeling my self confidence leave my body haha. What do you guys think about this? Any advice?",

        "body": "What is your school\u2019s policy regarding PTO and snow days? For example: If you have a pre-planned personal day approved, but then a snow day is called, do you get that day back or do you just lose it? What if you\u2019re out on bereavement, does that change things?\nI am potentially going to be in this situation this week (my father just passed and there is heavy snow in the forecast), but I was curious what other districts do before I approach my admin. I want to make sure we can plan the funeral around my time off, as my family lives on the other side of the country and I need to factor in travel time too. Is this something I should talk to my union rep about?",

Working with children is draining, both physically and mentally. I've been really sad because I've been trying to get other jobs (with adults) without any luck. My salary sucks, and my colleagues don't see me as their equal. They think I'm not as professional or a \"good teacher\" as them, and when I'm supporting them in the classroom (not teaching) they use me to do them favors... \"Go get this, go downstairs and get that for me, this classroom is messy, can you sweep the floor?\" and that really bothers me... I've cried a lot and I'm scared I will get deeply depressed. I've struggled with depression my whole life and I have been on meds and all that. I know I have to suck it up and just deal with it, but I feel like I can't. I just feel like I don't like working with children that age, and again, I'm deeply concerned about my mental health.

I tried being a daycare teacher and that was absolutely horrible. I didn\u2019t even last 6 months. To be fair though, I worked with toddlers and still continued to struggle with my mental health. \n\nI see horror stories more often than good ones. I\u2019ve heard from many people that the behavior of student has got out of control and that some teachers spend more time correcting those behaviors than actually working with students. I hear so much about how teachers are groomers and are brainwashing students (I know this is absolutely false and teachers are teaching to the curriculum set by their department of education). Also, I live in America\u2026 I\u2019m am terrified that a day will come when someone comes into the school with intentions to hurt the students. \n\nI have lost my motivation and have been told by loved ones to just work through it and try it out before I decide I do not want to do it anymore, but it\u2019s not that easy. I have a job that pays great, but I\u2019m order to get my license, I would have to take at least 3 months off unpaid. This is a huge financial decision choice to make and I am hopelessly lost.",

        "title": "Should I negotiate or move on?",
        "body": "Sorry for long post. I'll TL;DR by highlighting the main question/info.\n\nLittle context: I was a student teacher from August to second week of October, then took over my CT's maternity as an LTS, and this semester I am a building sub all at the same school. Last Friday, the principal called me in to basically test the waters on my interest level in staying for next year. To keep things clear: he admitted they do not have a plan yet for next year for the department I would be in, and that they are working on details over the next couple of weeks, but he wanted my input rather than assuming anything. It all felt very above board, and I have appreciated his level of advocacy for me all throughout these different transitions.\n\nHere's my dilemma. I have already seen the salary schedule with the project COL increase for next year. And step 1 for me with a master's is... not even close to what I hoped for starting salary. There are several districts in my state with infinitely more lucrative rates. Of course, no guarantee any of those districts will be hiring or will hire me if I apply. Even so, it's definitely on the low end of starting pay for me. \n\nOn the one hand: I like the department teachers here, I like that they enforce a mentoring system for first year teachers, the curriculum is basically already laid out for me so I would just have to worry about putting a twist on the lesson plans which is a huge stress relief, the district regularly devotes time to PLCs, and I love my kids from last semester and many have told me they want me to stay. The benefits are also quite nice--my health insurance is wonderful and no cost to me.\n\nOn the other hand: lower starting pay, a 25 minute commute that I am getting a little sick of, and a worry that I may not grow as a teacher if I hunker down here instead of moving on to another pasture.\n\n**So here's my question, I guess. Is it at all reasonable to think I can negotiate myself up to step 2, accounting for the year I've already spent within this school?** They are intimately familiar with all my work, and I have been paid for that work, but I'm not sure if this is a pipe dream. **And beyond that, has anyone ever successfully negotiated an additional step for previous college-level teaching experience? As it was part time over the course of two years, it would only count as 1 year. But with that, I could justify why I should be at step 3**. This would still be lower than my ideal salary, but I also recognize my ideal salary is definitely on the high end and this would be a reasonable compromise.\n\nOr is getting to step 2 or even 3 super unlikely, or even not worth trying to negotiate for? I've never really negotiated for myself at any job, so this is intimidating to me. Would it just be better to write this off in my mind as a non-possibility and look for greener pastures? Like I said, I intend to apply elsewhere no matter what as I was not offered a job here yet. But it would be nice to have some ideas on board before decision making starts being thrown at me.",

        "body": "This is a difficult decision. I love my students so much. I love being able to connect and share my passion for social studies with them. I have had amazing moments with my students, both in the sense of having a student finally \"get it\" and understand the content as well as in the sense of being able to support a student's emotional needs through very difficult times. I love my job and the environment I'm in. However, the one thing that is pulling me away from this job is the pay. I currently teach 3 different subjects and each year I have taught something completely different. I am recently married and moved across town now commuting a significant amount of time to and from work each day. Most of my weekends and evenings are spent lesson planning and grading for all of these different subjects and at this point with the current inflation and all of my life changes I feel my salary isn't enough or worth is anymore. We have a strict pay scale system so asking for a raise is not an option.  \n\nSo, I am considering looking for a new job. I would love a remote teaching job if possible, but ideally, I would like something that makes more than I do now ($35k/year before tax).  \n\nDo I tell my administrators that I'm looking? Every job I look at requires 2-5 references, most requiring 1-2 supervisor references, and says it will automatically mail them a questionnaire about me after I input their information. I didn't want to have to tell them until it was more concrete that I had a new position in case I didn't find anything but it feels like I will have to. I have been here for all 4 years of my teaching experience. Advice on what to do? We have a strict pay scale so a raise isn't an option.",

I can\u2019t help that I\u2019m younger than even the teachers who graduated the same year as me, or that I look quite younger than my age. Yet it always feels as though I\u2019m treated like a child. \nThe thing that set me off today is I had a minor altercation with the school\u2019s security guard this morning. I was leaving campus to get something I had forgotten in my car which is parked straight outside. He resisted me leaving saying it\u2019s against school rules then quite literally yelled at me. I was in so much disbelief that I simply gave in and walked back into the building. \nI\u2019ve never in my life been treated with so much disrespect and micro-aggression.

        "body": "So, for context: I am an English teacher for non-natives at a franchise of a very big Language School in my country.\n\nAt this franchise, our boss has no contracts nor do we have any kind of security or even anything. The teacher's lounge is even frequently used because it is the only \"classroom\" at ground level and the school has no accessibility. As I write this, he is trying to deceive a student on the phone while failing to set up the company computer so I can teach an online class (we are not allowed to even use the company wifi, let alone teach online classes on our own devices). I don't want to stress with exchange rates to talk about payment, so: a colleague of mine went to a neighborhood schoold and is working half my hours and getting paid more than me by around 20%.\n\nRecently a lot of teachers left the school. One was sick, something with the eaner ear that stops her from standing or even reading without getting nausea. He always bad-mouthes her when she is mentioned. Another one quit on the spot because he erased some of the hours he had worked from the official documents. There was the one with the new job and a couple others that also found better jobs, another one went to uni and he (the boss) didn't want to accomodate hours so he quit.\n\nBoss has started hiring left right and center with no discerniment. I am already working from 7am to 9pm to cover all that I can, he hired a 16 yo to be a teacher, he hired a guy that barely speaks our native tongue, even his own wife came to cover with no training, and he is lying to all the students about the changes. He keeps saying that the teachers are sick or something happen, and even when he had to transfer me to another student he told my old classroom that I was sick, but not only I was not coming back to them so that was false hope, I am teaching at the same time another class just across the hall, so they saw me there today and were like \"wait, if you are not sick why do we have a new teacher?\"\n\nStudents pay extra to have private lessons and get thrown into group classes, group classes dismantle and someone not paying extra ends up getting private lessons. The boards are literally falling from the wall and we can't complain because according to him \"we don't need them to teach and are not supposed to use them\", there is a fan and an AC in the classroom but both work intermittently because he turns down the power to them to save energy. He refuses to hire a secretary for the morning period so me and the janitor are the only ones here. When someone calls, he pretends to be someone else to avoid talking about things he doesn't wanna talk in the moment. He fired our only security guard in October for \"chatting too much with teachers\" and hasn't hired anyone since even though there was an armed robbery on the street behing the school.\n\nDo you guys ever feel bad for the students for leaving the school knowing it won't get better and they would learn more anywhere else? Because I can't take it here anymore and it's draining all my will to teach, teaching in such an awful place. Not to mentiok the many times he changes our schedule without telling us about it and not paying when we show up.",

        "body": "I\u2019m currently student teaching for social studies and am being weighed down by many things. Lack of motivation to lesson plan, thinking activities will take longer than they actually do, student apathy at an all time high, and not getting great feedback from my cooperating teacher. \n\nI feel like my cooperating teacher expects me to be just like them, and wants me to prepare barely any content for electives covering subjects I don\u2019t have much content knowledge on. They also want me to just discuss topics with students and not use PowerPoint slides. \n\nI am currently debating if I should still pursue my masters despite having a really shitty student teaching experience. I don\u2019t wanna be put in debt and have the option to just pursue history, as I am getting an additional bachelors in history. I also currently enjoy my part time college job more than student teaching, which says a lot. I just am not happy.\n\nAny advice?",

        "body": "I\u2019m a long term sub in between two jobs right now (same school) and I\u2019m staying in the school for day-to-day coverage until the new job starts. \n\nI am frequently in classes for 30 mins or 1 hour at a time, just watching a class while a teacher is in a meeting. \n\nToday, I went into fifth grade to watch a class for thirty minutes while their teacher went to a meeting. She had gave me short instructions about what they were supposed to be doing on their computers and told me to just monitor them. I did exactly that, walking around, reminding kids to get back on track,\netc. \n\nIt was a bit chatty and noisy so I did tell them to quiet down several times. I told them that it was okay to whisper amongst their table groups but if they were yelling across the room to their friend, it was not allowed. It got to the point where I had to set a timer for 60 seconds and told them if I heard a voice in that time frame that I would reset the timer from the beginning and we would start another 60 seconds. They failed a few times and we ended up doing 5 mins of this before we got 60 seconds of complete silence. \n\nThe teacher comes back, and she immediately says \u201cwhat is going ON in here? Why is it SO loud?!\u201d and looks directly at me when she says it. I just kinda shook my head because I was so unsure how to respond. She started telling the kids that they would have to do an hour of their computer program instead of the 30 minutes she allotted with me because they \u2018obviously weren\u2019t doing anything\u2019 while she was gone. \n\nShe then turns to me and starts scolding me in front of the whole class. She asked if they were like this the whole class and I told her we tried to do a minute of silence and she interrupts me saying \u201ca MINUTE? they are supposed to be silent the entire time!\u201d I was trying to explain to her that I was allowing them to whisper with their table partners as long as their voices weren\u2019t yelling to other tables and she said something along the lines of \u201cYou have to learn that being a good teacher means if you give an inch they take a mile.\u201d She was also upset that they weren\u2019t using their headphones and they were playing their computers volume out loud. I just had no idea what to say. I told her I was sorry and that some students let me know that they did not have headphones and so I told them to listen to it on a low volume. She said \u201cyeah LOW but at this point it\u2019s distracting everyone! I can hear them all the way down the hall!\u201d Again I apologized and she said \u201cwhatever, it\u2019s fine, have a nice day\u201d and just waves me away with her back facing me.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, I felt like I wanted to cry. I really did not know the extent of the rules and all she told me was to make sure they were on task, which they were. I am not sure what to do if this situation ever happens again. I feel like I was too stunned to speak.",

I\u2019ve already went to observe her class for a couple days and the class seems pretty manageable with a clear schedule. I\u2019m licensed but still pretty new (with only 1.5 years of experience of teaching).\n\nI\u2019m wondering how I should properly portray my \u201cauthority\u201d in the classroom. My classroom management could be better. I have lots to learn but I build great relationships with my kiddos, however it\u2019s probably because I\u2019m more \u201clenient\u201d than I should be. I don\u2019t care about being friends or likes by the students; but I give too many opportunities to \u201ccorrect\u201d a behavior instead of just following with immediate consequence. (Which I plan to improve on while in this sub placement).\n\nI want to keep it brief. Basically just introducing myself. Get to know them a little and then just letting them know how things are going to go for the next 2 months. I plan on sticking by the teacher\u2019s structure she has already established; it\u2019s not my classroom and I\u2019m not trying to make it so. I just want to ensure the teacher comes back to the same class she left and that the kids don\u2019t take this as an opportunity to act like gremlins while she is on leave. \ud83d\ude05 \n\nSo, any advice on how I should get the message across that \u201cI want us to learn and have fun but if you give me a hard time, I\u2019m going to give you one\u201d kinda of talk?",

        "body": "Years ago when I was in the 9th grade I was a violinist, albeit a truly unhappy one. I was only in it because my parents forced me to do it and if I didn't well... everything unpleasant begins (Asian Parents). \n\nI hated the violin and I began to hate the music as well. It was no longer fun for me at some point. At that point I felt that if I had to force myself to practice and if I hated waking up especially on the days I had orchestra, I needed to stop.\n\nOne day I tried to talk to my music teacher about not joining orchestra next year. She got annoyed and said, \"No, I don't want to hear it. Leave.\" I tried to explain but then she just said, \"No, other people have worked hard to make what we do happen and you aren't being fair to them. Don't talk to me about it, do your own thing.\" \n\nNeedless to say, I just didn't sign up the next year and just told my parents I didn't make it to the \\[imaginary\\] sophomore tryouts. \n\n13 years later I am an adult, former Muay Thai fighter, who teaches boxing fundamentals to youngins in my free time. Once in a while I'll see a kid who clearly doesn't want to be there. Usually it's that the parent wants a really \"manly\" son or a \"tough\" daughter. Or dad wants to live his failed dream of being a pro boxer through his son. The kids who really hate it usually want to either do other sports or are those bookworm types that loathe sports (nothing wrong with that IMO).\n\nI try to counsel the kid and let them know it isn't their fault they don't like what they are doing. I told them it is okay to stop doing something if you don't love it, so you can do something that you do love. They are tough enough and can show it in other ways. I tell the parents that their kids don't like doing this and I can't teach what we call heart in the world of ring fighting. They get mad and throw a fit but in the end I feel like I am doing the them and the kid a favor. In the end, I never did have a kid who \\*didn't\\* get stronger or at least have more confidence when they left. Some kids I taught did end up fighting in junior tournaments and I'm just as proud of the ones that didn't, and did other things.\n\nAdmittedly I do still hold somewhat of a grudge against that music teacher each time a kid doesn't want to be in the gym. I honestly think I did for those kids what she couldn't do. But to be fair, my classmates and the music teacher worked really hard to raise money for our orchestra and convince the school to give us more funding. That teacher poured her heart and soul into music and really helped a lot of kids get scholarships.\n\nThoughts?",

        "body": "Hello, I am a graduate student at UCLA that is looking for **California public high school teachers** to participate in an interview for my capstone research project. \n\nOur goal during this interview is to better understand the use of **surveillance technology** (e.g., app/website/software that monitors the digital activities of students on devices) at your school and how you think it impacts students. \n\nCompanies that sell surveillance technology to schools (e.g., Gaggle, GoGuardian, Securly, iBoss, Bark, Social Sentinel, etc.) claim that such technology ensures the safety and well-being of students and schools. We want to better understand this claim, as well as the risks that surveillance technology may pose, as reported by those who are familiar with this technology. \n\nThe interviews will take place on Zoom and last 30-60 minutes. All eligible interviewees will receive a $50 gift card.\n\n**If you are interested and eligible, please complete**[ **this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOlvvXyBPN0PuPpX4P6TGmFnjW_fSomrmDPNH4mQXO0pE7Gw/viewform) **and a member of our team will follow up with you.**\u00a0\n\nThank you!",

My cooperating teacher openly says she hates her job, berates the students (4th grade) for not understanding concepts, and has been increasingly abrasive towards me. I understand the stress and disrespect teachers endure can be overwhelming. I am trying to have empathy. \n\nI\u2019m in week 7, with 8 or so more to go. Around week three, I asked her when I should pick up more subjects and she told me she preferred if I observed her longer. Ok. Last week, she yelled at me because I hadn\u2019t heard her directions and asked for clarification on where to go (taking the kids out). Later, I told her I seems like she\u2019s frustrated with me and asked why, she said it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t taken initiative to take over more subjects. I have been trying my best to simultaneously learn, help the students learn, and respect her boundaries in the classroom. \n\nWhen I explained my perspective, she let me know she\u2019s scared to relinquish the class to me in case her class gets out of control under me and she\u2019ll have to deal with it once I end my student teaching. I offered to sit down with the school\u2019s instructional coach and her to see how we can move forward in a positive way and she said she would prefer not to. (She doesn\u2019t like the instructional coach)\n\nApparently this teacher is known to be difficult to work with,and I have been offered to switch placements to a teacher in the school whose personality and pedagogy is more aligned with mine. This was offered over a week ago, without me saying anything to admin about my experience.  \n\nWhen I suggested switching to my CT, blaming the teacher\u2019s work load so she wouldn\u2019t take it personally, she began crying and said she hates herself.\n\nI know it\u2019s going to be awkward and cause drama, which I really don\u2019t want , but I want to look into the option of switching. This is painful. I knew this experience was going to be challenging but I never predicted that it would go this way. \n\nMy friends and family encourage that I switch but I\u2019d like to hear from objective folks in education. Should I just stick it out and hope for the best? The host teacher says she wants me to stay, and that once I pick up more responsibility that things will get better. I would prefer to not start over in another room. I also worry that she is unpredictable and unstable, and that eventually she will write a bad report about me no matter what I do. \n\nThank you!",

When I was a static TA and more worried about my job security, I chose not to come out at work. Now that I'm a substitute, I introduce myself to my students with my proper title (Mr.) This sometimes draws attention from middle and high school students. Some students try to test me (calling out: Miss, Mrs, Mr to see what I'll respond to). This doesn't bother me, as I know they're just testing boundaries. A couple of students have straight-up asked me, \"are you transgender?\" which I have more trouble responding to. \n\nI am not allowed to discuss matters of gender or sexuality (separate things, but listed together in the handbook) with students. Honestly, my identity is not something I wish to discuss with them (or most people) either. \n\nIs it best for me just to ignore the question, as I have been so far? Should I tell the students, \"I understand you are curious, but that is a very personal question and not a polite thing to ask. Should I just answer truthfully (\"yes\") and refuse to elaborate?",

        "body": "Good afternoon, teachers.  \n\nI had an occurrence today that has not only shaken me, but also infuriated me.  It's Sunday afternoon, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to deal with this garbage on a Sunday.  Or any day, preferably.  \n\nA bit of background, I am a 7th grade geography teacher in rural Oklahoma.  In 7th grade we have several hot button topics, like climate change, human impact, religion and political systems.  I can imagine you might know where this is going at this point.\n\nI got a knock at my door from a parent of a student, that I've known for the better part of 30 years at this point.  Let's call him Mark.  Mark and I grew up together, and Mark had always been like a neighborhood big brother to me, since he's about four years older.  He has lived around the corner from me for a while now, because we both live in the houses we grew up in, so of course he knows where I live.  \n\nMark, earlier in his life, not sure when, converted into Christianity and has become what one could only describe as fundamentalist or extremist.  \n\nToday, when I opened my door, I'd hardly say I'm surprised, but still haven't wanted to deal with the situation.  I knew this would be an issue.  His issue, naturally, is that during 7th grade, we introduce our students to the idea of world religion.  We cover five major religions, because the focus of 7th grade Oklahoma geography is the eastern hemisphere.  The five major religions we cover are Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. \n\nAt first it was easy to tell that he was mad, but he wanted to give an appearance of being reasonable.  It quickly devolved.  \n\nHis first full sentence to me was, \"I don't know if we can't get this bullshit figured out today or if I'll need to take it to the school board.\" So, he woke up and chose violence, it appears.  Naturally, it put me on the immediate defensive. \n\nLater on he basically made it abundantly clear he is not interested in having his child in a class where they are being preached to.  Which I steadfastly disagree I am doing.  He also made it clear that he was never taught this in school, to which I retorted, \"World religion has always been a subject of Oklahoma social studies standards.\"\n\nDuring our approximately 20 minutes of \"discussion,\" he accused me of attempting to change his child's opinions of his religion, of teaching things that aren't related to geography, and to trying to explain to me that it doesn't matter if there are other religions because all of those people are going to go to Hell.  \n\nNaturally it's my day off.  I want to relax on my day off.  I wasn't having any of this garbage.  I immediately retorted to everything he said.  He had mentioned a couple times that the US is Christian to which I bluntly recited the first amendment.  By the end of the conversation he disrespectfully turned tail, walked away and started shouting something back at me, which I can't hear because I'm HoH anyway.  So I told him to just go away and to leave me alone.  Take it up with my boss.  \n\nThe idea that I am teaching his children how to believe is absurd especially since as a disclaimer to the students at the start of the unit I told them I was not to be preaching to them, and that my own beliefs are not to be interjected, and that I am not interested in presenting those beliefs.  What I am to cover is the basics.  What they believe, how many of them there are, where they are originally from, what their major cities and cultural beliefs are, and whether they are mono or polytheistic.  That's it.  I am not any of these religions, and barely claim any faith at all. \n\nI am already heavily on the fence about returning next year, but this might have pushed me to the edge of getting out.  My degrees are in economics and marketing.  I can make more money with less bullshit.  I opened the door because he had always been cordial and civil with me up until this point.  Never again.  \n\n\nSorry about the rant.",

        "body": "I'm having an issue with my coteacher doing what I believe is cheating with my students. She pulls the special ed students for small group during all assessments, which is what she's supposed to do, but they all come back making exceeding on every test. If I give her the answer key they'll make a 100 and when I've forgotten the answer key, my first period students will do way worse than the ones she has after the other teacher she works with gives her an answer key. Then I have first period students who have blatantly told me that she gave them the wrong answer.\n\nFrom what I understand, what she does is give them 2 options instead of 4, and basically gives them the right answer and the most obvious wrong answer. If they go to choose the wrong answer she'll re-explain the question and emphasize reading the correct answer. Obviously if they pay attention at all they'll get the answers right.\n\nI know that she knows she's not showing their true understanding because while she brags about them passing all their tests because she's such a great teacher, she predicted every single one of them making the lowest category on our state tests. She has told me 2 students don't know their sounds and that several students \"Have MID so you know they can't really learn much of anything\". It seems very much like she knows state scores come out well after when she'd have a new job and just wants to look good in the moment.\n\nI've also had a co teacher before that did basically nothing though. She'd pull the kids, take them to the media center, and sit on her phone while they worked. That's obviously not ideal either.\n\nI guess I'm wondering as a pretty new teacher myself, what is the real amount of helping a co-teacher should do during these assessments? I've emailed her that students \"spread a rumor\" about her cheating and so she stopped taking non-IEP students with her (she used to literally just bring students who she liked, AKA the ones who shared their food with her, and they would also magically get way higher scores)  but I can hardly not let her take students who are required to be small group tested. What do I do?",

New York is one of the states that requires a masters degree within 5 years of graduating college.\n\nHere's my question. I see myself leaving the state and pursuing a life in the mountains, Colorado or Utah is where I'm thinking. If I was to make that move, would I be better off staying in New York for an extra year and getting the masters degree, so I could have a better salary, or go out there with no masters degree. I know salary ranges out west are pretty bad relative to New York, so what would you recommend. \n\nFinal question, if I was to go for a masters, I'd be interested in going for an engineering degree. A degree that would allow me to continue teaching if I choose to, but also gives me the option to step into the private industry if I choose to. Anyone have any recommendations for a online masters programs that would give me the credits required teach, but also gives me a masters in  any field of engineering. Preferably online. Thanks!",

I don't mean the parent that is genuinely trying really hard but having a struggle with parenting, I mean the parent who doesn't do anything while their child has a zero percent and is failing every term AND not getting high school credit as a ninth grader. \n\nThere are a handful of students that are consistently failing and despite all my best efforts and doing everything that I can, nothing will stick because there's no parent support at home. \n\nI mean... no response to failing notices. No response to emails letting the parents know of big deadlines. Not coming to the parent teacher conferences. Nothing.\n\nI also feel like there's no excuse because course content is almost entirely online for my class... AND parents can have observer accounts to see what's going on in the course. \n\nI'm the personality type that really worries, but my admin has been assuring me that although I do everything I can, I can't fix what goes on at home. \n\nIt's just a difficult truth to stomach. \n\nIf you've read this far thanks for reading my rant. \ud83d\ude05",

        "body": "[https://www.texastribune.org/2023/02/24/texas-teacher-shortage-task-force/](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/02/24/texas-teacher-shortage-task-force/)\n\nNearly a year after **Gov.** **Greg Abbott** **ordered a task force to look at the state\u2019s teacher shortages,** the group is recommending that lawmakers ***increase salaries, improve training and commit to respecting teachers\u2019 time.***\n\nThe job of the task force \u2014 **a mix of educators and school administrators** \u2014 was to **investigate why these shortages exist, recommend policy changes to the TEA and consider more flexibility in the teacher certification process.** The report will be shared with the members of the House and Senate education committees and is available to the public [online.](https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/tvtf-final-report.pdf)\n\n**\"We will develop and implement strategies that attract, retain, and support highly qualified educators** to provide students across the state with even greater opportunities to learn and grow,\" he said.\n\nWhile Texas and the rest of the country have dealt with teacher shortages for years, the pandemic exacerbated them. Shifting requirements on masking and the closure then reopening of schools have taken a toll on teachers. At the same time, schools have become the center of the state\u2019s culture wars, and teachers are caught in the crossfire.\n\n**Meanwhile, teacher compensation has stagnated. Texas ranks 28th in the nation for teacher pay, $7,652 less than the national average,** according to the latest National Education Association [report](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/teacher-salary-benchmarks).\n\n# Here's what the Task Force says will fix the teacher shortage in Texas: \n\n***1) Teacher should get raises***\n\n**The task force recommends that the state increase the basic allotment, which is currently at $6,160 per student.** State law requires that school districts must use 30% of any additional revenue they receive to increase employee salaries. The allotment has not increased since 2019, when lawmakers overhauled the school finance system.\n\n\u201cSalaries have not kept up with recent inflation, and pay disparities continue to exist across the state,\u201d the task force noted in the report.\n\nThe task force is also asking lawmakers to raise the percentage of the allotment that must go to teacher salaries, though it did not say by how much.\n\nIn addition, the group recommends increasing the minimum salary schedule, which is the minimum teachers should be making per year of experience. **Currently, it would take at least 20 years of experience for teachers to make over $54,000 a year. While many school districts already pay more than the minimum salary, teachers at small and rural school districts earn the minimum amount or slightly more.**\n\nThe report said the total compensation teachers receive must also be increased as health care costs on average went up about 5% over the past 20 years, but the state and district\u2019s contribution to health plans remained the same.\n\n***2) More training and support***\n\nWhile the task force believes pay is a top priority, it also called for a better employment pipeline and improved retention techniques to keep teachers in the field.\n\n**The group recommends expanding programs and pathways for high school students wanting to become teachers.** It also said the **state should establish and fund teacher residency programs that would pay would-be teachers to train for a year and work with an experienced educator in a public PK-12 classroom, similar to the medical field.**\n\n\u201cResearch shows that teacher residency models increase teacher retention, effectively place teachers in hard-to-staff areas, and positively impact student outcomes,\u201d the task force said.\n\n**The task force recommended expanding mentorship programs for teachers and helping them take more leadership roles.** It also said teachers spend much of their time creating and looking for lesson plans and should have easy access to high-quality teaching materials to help them.\n\n***3) Better working conditions needed***\n\nIn a task force poll, **teachers said that an unsustainable workload is the No. 1 reason they leave the workforce. They also cited campus morale, discipline and lack of adequate mental health support as contributing factors to workplace stress.**\n\nThe **task force recommends that the Legislature fund a study of how teachers use their time to better understand their duties and how to streamline them.** Administrators should also redesign their district\u2019s schedule to allow teachers more time for planning and development, the task force said. In addition, school systems and **the TEA need to adopt better staffing plans so teachers don\u2019t get more work when a colleague is out and a substitute is unavailable**.\n\nThe **task force is also calling for more counseling staff to combat student behavioral issues** and offer more effective disciplinary measures. **School administrators should also receive training on best discipline practices and how to foster a positive learning environment.**\n\n\u201cI am confident that state leadership will act upon these recommendations which are the result of nearly a year\u2019s worth of collaboration and hard work among district leaders, teachers, educational organizations, and other stakeholders,\u201d said Josu\u00e9 Tam\u00e1rez Torres, task force chair and a 4th and 5th grade bilingual math teacher.",

Yet I see a lot of aita (am I the a-hole)  type things about students getting snappy with subs for not knowing about their IEPs and people being supportive for the snarky student \"standing up for themselves and advocating for their accommodations\". It sort of annoys me because I've never been entitled to that information. Maybe if a teacher is nice enough to include that information but that is rare. I'm lucky if a get a lesson plan and a seating chart. 90% of the time though I go in blind and anyone that has ever subbed knows that students lie a lot about things to get one over on the substitute. This was super prevalent during mask mandates where they would lie about mask exemptions. I had to physically call the office on more than one occasion to verify the info. So my question is if other places outside Florida provide IEP information to day subs?",

I taught 8th two years, 6th one year, and then I quit my job due to severe mental health struggles/burnout. For this past year I\u2019ve been a private nanny for one of my former coworkers while working another part time job on the weekends. I chose my current jobs very purposefully so that I could not be a part of society while I recovered. I am now back on the job hunt and tentatively looking at some education/education adjacent jobs while also perusing other options. I\u2019m telling myself that if I\u2019m going to teach again, I\u2019m going to do something very different. I\u2019m about to have an interview at a Montessori school if anyone has specific experience with that. \n\nHere are the questions I\u2019ve thought of so far to help me make my decision:\n\n1. Salary. I would never go back for less than what I previously made and obviously the more money the better. \n2. Daily schedule. I want to get a sense of duties, planning periods, meeting requirements, lesson plan requirements, etc. \n3. Curriculum-level of freedom/guidance/expectations for working with other teachers etc. \n4. Discipline procedures. \n5. Not exactly sure how to phrase these last ones which target culture but I\u2019m thinking something along the lines of: What would teachers say they like best and least about working here?",

Since I'm only a temporary contract, I and my peers are being ousted to make way for contract teachers who have been displaced (no malice to them, they're in a rough position they didn't choose too).\n\nOur district is one of the largest in the state in both physical size and population and I live right smack in the center so to enter the field in another district means a minimum of a 45 minute commute assuming weather and traffic patterns are fair. But those positions are also being contested by my 200-some-odd peers...\n\nI just got my very first classroom this year after 4 years of long-term substituting, and the district \"solution\" is to offer all of us a chance to remain active in the district by being subs with no change or improvement to the pay scale or benefits despite a wall of highly qualified people who could be joining the ranks (take home is roughly 1/3rd of what I make daily as a first year teacher, no benefits, no sick days, even as a long-term) so that's simply not an option. The entire district is on a hiring freeze and any specializations like SPED would need me to go back to school first so I need to look around outside schools.\n\nI'm going to pursue whatever I can within education directly; it's been my passion for as long as I can remember, but I also have to face reality and see what else is on the table.\n\n**The Question:**\n\nWhat are other teaching-adjacent jobs out there? I haven't had to think about it before nor been able to figure out where to start looking. It hurts to explore the options so I could use a little boost or push towards what might be out there for me.\n\nI am Elementary Ed and prefer working with the kids directly over administrative stuff. I'll be looking at private schools but there are so few here that I'd like to see what else is out there.\n\nAny ideas what I could look for? I *really* don't want to go back to retail unless I absolutely have to.\n\nThank you",

        "body": "First year 7th grade ELA teacher at a rural Title 1. Someone with a much higher salary than me decided that our End-of-Year diagnostic and final benchmark would open back-to-back starting this week. Our heads up was an email that went out Friday afternoon. While the diagnostic seems to have some merit, our middle school teachers have found that the benchmarks are consistently far above grade level and do not match where we are in the curriculum at any given time. On top of this, both of these \u201cfinal\u201d assessments are being administered with 3 full months left in our school year. After these tests, students are so test fatigued, they will need a day or two brain break. \n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t irritating enough, this has also left me with only a 5-day window after testing to administer my last major grade of the 9-weeks, a standards-based reading and writing test covering the novel we\u2019ve been working on since we returned from Christmas. This won\u2019t be enough time to account for all the absences I typically have, and I would be left entering zeros for kids who are out or don\u2019t come to make it up in the last few days before the 9-weeks ends. \n\nI don\u2019t give participation grades (other than a very small one that counts for 10% of their final grade). This will mean I\u2019m either short 1 major grade or I have to come up with something quick. \n\nAre other districts also scheduling these tests one after another? Any advice for how you would manage the scheduling issue with my last test at this stage?",

They are both 5 years old. Most of the time this one boy teases and sometimes hurts his other classmates. If I call him out, he will start crying like it was him who was bullied. I would explain what he did and make him realize the result of his actions and what he would feel if he was the one to be hurt and teased but he will always make excuses and will not say a single 'sorry' to the ones involved. He will do the written activities when his mom arrives. The class is definitely done by the time.\n\nThis other boy is just so energetic and wont listen to me. He lacks focus and keeps running inside the classroom. Him being a hyperactive sometimes lead to hurting a classmate too. He won't do activities also. Just like the other one, he waits for his mommy for him to start working on activities. This one I think has ADHD but I am afraid that the parent might be offended if I ask of her to have her son assessed by a professional. \n\nWhat do I do? I've tried various types of approach to know their interests but no luck.\n\nThank you for your responses in advance.",

        "body": "I wish someone told me before entering this profession that the position you have at the start of the school year might not be the position you get to keep for next year. I entered my first teaching job as an 8th grade social studies teacher because it's something I enjoy teaching, and generally speaking we want teachers to work with content they like and are familiar with. My classroom management has not been stellar, as my observations show, but I'm also a first-year teacher who also happened to pass his second observation with flying colors. I assumed I'd be staying on in the same position next year because I fulfilled my plan of support, improved on my classroom management skills, and redid my approach to teaching to keep students more engaged.\n\nInstead, when I called into the office about their plans for next year, I'm told that I either have to be transferred to another school, starting all over again if I want to continue teaching social studies after a year of getting to know the staff and students, or work in the autism program if I want to stay. Now I have prior experience working with special needs students and the program we have is excellent, but my principal also wants me to get special ed certified. That means in most circumstances, getting a masters' at potentially $10,000-$30,000 and a full year of practicum, on top of my teaching responsibilities. Moreover, some of the grants and scholarships that could go towards that program would basically require me to stay in special ed for nearly ten-years, if I don't want those grants to turn into loans. I already owe $20,000 in loans as is and took this job for the  SLF if you stay in district for five years. Certification is completely counterintuitive. \n\nWhat really confuses me is that if I apparently can't handle a room of 28-31 teenagers, why is my classroom management suddenly appropriate for a classroom full of students at differing levels of ability, ages, and emotional needs? I have prior experience of working with special needs as a EA, but assisting a classroom of special needs kids and running the room for special needs kids cannot be the same. I realize that this is probably admin trying to veer a younger, newer teacher into a direction that would definitely assuage staffing issues, but this is quite literally what I didn't sign up for when I took this job.\n\nIs this normal in teaching? Because if this is how it's going to be, where I can't follow the direction I had set for myself and keep doing what I can do best at, then I don't see myself lasting for very long in this profession. I'm probably going to take the transfer, but after going through all these hoops to get this job, pass observations, pass my plan of support, putting all the effort in to make my teaching style work, and then get told \"You're not doing this next year, you're going to be working in a program that your content area has no relation with\", then no wonder teacher retention is so low. \n\nI'm sorry that this is more of a rant than asking for advice or anything, but I had to vent. This entire situation has been giving me stress headaches and poor nights' sleep over where I'll be next year, and that's not why I took this job.",

On a personal level, they treat me like an equal and we hang out after school, text after work, go out to lunch, are Facebook friends, etc. \n\nMost of the teachers at the other grade level are the complete opposite. They've literally screamed at me in front of the rest of the team (because I told one teacher about a meeting they were supposed to be at and had forgotten about), will ask me not to worry about completing some tasks then get upset that I didn't do them, won't talk to me when I'm sitting with them, etc. And on a personal level, they actually rejected my friend requests and marked them as spam.\n\nI want to be the best TA I can be, especially since I hope to teach at this school in the future, but how can I do that for teachers who dislike me?

I really have no idea how things work in Canada, I'm starting to do some research but I thought I might ask the internet here and get a feel for what things are like over there and the job market (especially with teaching art, I've been lucky so far with getting to teach elementary art but I know there are a lot of places with those jobs completely sealed up). I tried looking up jobs in Ontario and BC but could only find private schools and like IB schools. I keep trying to find the regular ISD job postings but I can't quite find them or they don't have anything posted for huge districts which is super strange, there should be at least one job for a giant district right? I know this is going to take some time and I know there is the huge process of getting a Canadian teaching license (I might even need an extra degree!)

There\u2019s so much on the backend teachers deal with that we don\u2019t necessarily have to worry about. \n\nTo me it\u2019s like an LVN calling themselves an RN. \n\nBeing a para now will absolutely make me a better teacher in the near future.\nBeing a paraeducator isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of, we are vital to the education process- so why not just call yourself what you are? \n\nAm I wrong for holding this opinion? I feel as if I have the right to as a current paraeducator who is also a student teacher.",

Is there something I\u2019ve forgotten about being self-contained?\n\nThis change will happen regardless of my preference, so I\u2019m really looking for a mind-shift here. Those of you who love it, why do you prefer being self-contained?\n\nI\u2019m not interested in changing grade levels or schools.

        "body": "Hello, \n\nI'm a first-year teacher working my first LTO in Ontario, Canada. Last Monday, I caught a bad cold and requested Tuesday off work. I don't like to take time off work because I feel really guilty, which tends to add extra stress to me, and I constantly feel like I'm disappointing or even annoying the principal every time I should also say that just last month I got struck with a horrible chronic migraine that had me take a whole week off work because I was physically unable to move. I do not get sick so fast and easily so I feel like a burden to my job. I feel like they're going to replace me if I keep taking time off work. \n\nI thought I'd return by Wednesday, but the symptoms only worsened. I woke up Wednesday not being able to move my left side. I went to work on Thursday because it was a snow day, and I usually have only 3 students who show up on snow days. After school on Thursday, I went to the doctor, who gave me a transfer sheet to get some x-rays done. I also went to work on Friday, despite my throat and ear killing me. I figured I'd make it through the day okay so long as I took some Advil however, midway through the afternoon, I had a horrible and long coughing fit. I don't know how, but I made it through the day and went and got my x-rays done afterwards. \n\nFast forward to today when I woke up in the middle of the night unable to breathe (+ my throat and ear were still killing me). I ended up going to the ER because I couldn't just wait for my x-ray results to come on Monday, and lo and behold, they found pneumonia in my left lung. I do not have a fever, but I do get attacked with coughing fits here and there and my throat and ears hurt a lot when I don't take medication. \n\nNow I'm expected to take yet ANOTHER week off work (as per doctor's orders) and I'm sitting here stressed at 3 am wondering how I'm supposed to tell the principal that I cannot come in this whole week when the school struggled so much in trying to find replacements for me last week for the 2 days I took off. \n\nWhat should I do? I wear a mask at school, and I was thinking if I kept one on, then I might be able to make it through the week, but then I get scared thinking of getting one of the little ones sick.  Any advice on how to approach this? Am I being dramatic? \n\nI should clarify this is not COVID as I did a home test and it came back negative. It's just plain old pneumonia.",

Etc. I also just replaced a teacher that had done the job for 20 years, so the curriculum is outdated and had to start from scratch this year. This is my first year teaching and I thought I had recruited enough kids for next year, but only about 15 kids per period (5 periods combined of level 1 and 2 classes) actually signed up. Now my vice principal is telling me that that is too little kids per class and they are asking me to potentially give up one of those periods to teach another subject that is similar but DIFFERENT. They say I\u2019m qualified for it, but I looked at the standards and I am not. I also feel like they really don\u2019t understand how much work I already have on me, or else they wouldn\u2019t be asking me to teach 3 different classes. \n\nHow do I politely tell them that I don\u2019t meet the qualifications and that this would put on a completely unsustainable work load onto me?

        "title": "What should I do about my co-teacher?",
        "body": "New here, and have a genuine problem that I need advice about. Forgive me if this is not the place for this or if I did the wrong flare. I'll try to give pertinent information and try not to ramble. There is soooooo much I'm not including in this.\n\nThis is my first year as a teacher and work at a middle school. I was put on a co-taught team and two of my four classes are co-taught. I'm the Gen, my co-teacher is the SPED, and neither of us have real experience with co-teaching outside of an internship. I would say I have the professional education and they have the experience.\n\nWe have been generally getting along up until about two weeks ago. Before the change, they were constantly spending every moment trying to talk to me about personal issues they are going through, empty nest, dying family member, etc. During those times I would try to talk about upcoming lessons, how to improve student performance, opinion on lessons and management techniques with specific students, and so on. I could get some feedback from them and the classroom would work out. During class we got in a routine where they would lead the Ignite (drill) that I put together, and sometimes take the lead if I was working directly with a student, and I would lead everything else while they provided accommodations. Often I would provide the accommodations in the form of modified worksheets for the ease of timing. After a few months I became aware of the level of accommodations they were providing students, which was way more than required and very copy and paste oriented, in my opinion, this allowed very much for students to take advantage of learned helplessness. Sometimes they would even just do the work for the students. I tried talking to them about how we need to challenge the students and how we can't do the work for them and they insisted that every thing that was being provided was on every student's IEP and they HAD to do them.\n\nI knew something was off because of the SPED classes I have taken, so I talked to my Vice Principle (VP) for advice and they sent me to the head of SPED in the school. I sat down with the head of SPED and went over everything that was going on. From there I was more informed and went back to the classroom with a goal of trying to work with my co-teacher behind the scenes on what accommodations should and should not be given. They promised to provide a checklist of which student received what accommodations so I can be a more efficient Gen teacher and we could both be on the same page. They also said they were going to get a work table brought into the room for small groups, along with a couple other tasks. A month goes by and nothing, and I checked in twice for progress. I checked in with my VP again and she gave me directives, including talking with the head of SPED again on the checklist and what some of the accommodations look like in the classroom. This was about 6 weeks ago.\n\nI ended up directing my entire classroom, down to which students get small group with my co-teacher and what they are going to be responsible for. They jumped on board with it and ended up being, for a lack of a better description, submissive pleasing towards me. They would go so far as to describe four different scenarios on what to do with the students, giving pros and cons for all of them and then ask me which one I wanted them to do. I quickly got burnt out and put the ball back in their court with a comment like \"Whichever one you think works best for the students.\" Throughout all this, they where and still are having major issues with the other Gen teacher they co-taught with and was having multiple meetings on their performance with different Admin and the head of SPED. I admit I have also been increasingly standoffish, short with answers, and avoiding them for multiple reasons that have not been mentioned. My department chair and subject team have seen what has been going on and wonder how I haven't snapped yet. I have also sent a month long observation email about my co-teacher and what is going on in my classroom to two of the VPs, by request of my VP and team lead. This email also served as a form of journal for venting some of my frustrations.\n\nAbout a week and a half ago, they have suddenly stopped doing the Ignite in the classroom and basically anything to work with me, including not replying to my emails. They have been coming in when the bell rings or shortly after. They head straight for the work table, set up, and spend the class on their computer. They don't help manage the students anymore, and for the past couple days don't even say a word. I've tried sending students to work with them at the table for small group and they do bare minimum or would completely mess up the lesson by doing the work for them or look up answers on the internet to teach small group students something different. I've tried going over lessons with my co-teacher but can only get them to look a them via email. I want to ask what is going on but they leave before the bell rings or right as the bell rings when the students are packing up or leaving. Then during our planning periods they are no where to be found.\n\nTwo days ago they sent me an email asking to set up a meeting to go over upcoming professional observations and SLOs and they invited 2 other individuals to the meeting. I replied all along the lines of, \"Just come talk to me in person about both\" as at most it would have been a 5 minute conversation. They then sent the email again but directed it at the other two to set up a meeting. My co-teacher has a history of trying to sign me up for meetings, trainings, and meet and greets without my consent and at this time I had to put my foot down. I tried talking to them when they arrived to the next class and ask why we couldn't talk in person and it turned into a back and forth of them insisting they needed the meeting and that they HAD to meet with the other two individuals. I expressed that I was not going to a meeting but they were welcome to go if they needed to. They ended up walking away and arriving to the class late. After again talking with my VP, I replied all to the meeting request email again. The first subject required 1 sentence, the second subject required 2 and, on advice of my VP, I put in all the links, mapping to find the documents they needed, and reminders of when they originally were given access to all the information. This was done mainly so the other two on the email would know that my co-teacher has all the resources they needed to be successful. No reply. Yesterday they where completely tight lipped in both classes and didn't invite any students to the table. We passed each other in the hall at one point, it was just the two of us, and they said \"Thanks for the information\" and kept on walking. I tried to engage in conversation but they ignored me and kept walking on.\n\nAt this point I believe they are aware of the observation email I sent last month. Or something similar that is causing them to act like this. They have \"Turtled Up\" as I call it, gone into extreme defense mode so they can deflect anything that comes their way, claim innocence, and not take the blame of anything that may come their way. I've also recently learned of the term Gray Rocking, and I think that is what they are doing. My VP said they have a control issue and much of what they do is about having control of what is going on. I personally cannot run my classroom with a co-teacher who is not going to do anything or passive aggressively undermine me in front of the students. This happens here and there, most recently they told the small group they had \"Thats not true\" when I taught something to the whole class.\n\nIn all honesty, what should I do with my co-teacher? I'm going to keep writing my observations per request of my VP and to cover my back. I'm going to keep making requests for my co-teacher to provide this accommodation for that student. I do not want to play the game of email requests to schedule meetings just to talk, wasting other people's time who don't need to be there. But I can't continue to work in a cold shoulder environment and need to start communicating again. My students deserve better and my students with IEPs deserve to have their accommodations met.",

As an assessment - tests can be very black/white and offer hard data. 2. Can be used to help teach kids how to deal with anxiety and life\u2019s pressures (again, depending on how they are written and administered). 3. Helps hold students responsible for their own education/notes/coursework/etc. And finally, it helps prepare them for high school - and for those students who wish to go to post secondary. The ability to write a test is an art form after all. One I didn\u2019t fully master until I was almost in my third year of my undergrad.\n\nThat being said, I also know all the downsides of tests - this is what 75% of my instructors have been focusing on in teachers college whenever my peers have asked. I understand that they can be stressful - I have GAD and depression - and I don\u2019t want to cause my students undue stress. But if they are going to have a panic/anxiety attack. I rather they have it with me, where I can help talk them down.\n\nThere is nothing in the IEPs saying no to tests",

While you think this would mean a great class with tons of chances for one-on-one learning and interactions with the student, that is not the case.  They are easily my worst class. From the second they walk into the room it is almost non-stop complaining about everything (from basic classroom rules, what I'm teaching, what I'm supposedly not teaching, room temperature, etc.)  One of the benefits of it being a small class is that I can try a whole lot of things to get it to work but it just ends up with them just whining.  On top of that, I am a guy, the class has 9 girls.  I get constant yelling comments of \"Why are you looking at me?\" and \"Mr. B3N15, your making \\[OTHER STUDENT\\] reel uncomfortable\" as I walk past.  I had a girl dive across the room to try and pick up a paper airplane that she threw before I did and then started complaining that I pushed her, which ended in the comment \"There's 11 of us and 1 of you, they'll believe us\" They all (except for maybe 2-3 of them) hate me and I don't know what to do.  Any suggestions?",

        "body": "A little long, but I just wanted to share. \n\nThis just happened today. I know a lot of people hate people who step into others\u2019 conflicts, but I usually ask people to show respect when they are demeaning people who just want to keep their jobs. When this lady pulled the teacher line, I may have went a bit too far, but the end felt satisfying.  It just made me upset she would use our profession to be a jerk.\n\nI teach middle school and used to teach Preschool. Before that, I worked retail and food. One of my main jobs in college was at Target working in the deli, bakery, cafe, and Starbucks.\n\nI was shopping in the same target I used to work. The customer in front of me in line today was complaining to the cashier about another employee not being trained in the deli and kept changing her story. Here are thing she said in order:\n\n- She said nobody was in the deli and the guy in produce did not know how to do deli. She said \u201che said I would have to wait for them.\u201d \n- She said she asked the kid in the produce to cut the meat and he said he wasn\u2019t trained. \u201cHe needs to learn how to cut the meat so he can please customers. It is his job.\u201d She ranted to the cashier about this and demanded to get a manager.\n- She continued saying that nobody over there knew how to cut meat and was irate about how she was inconvenienced and he should have just done it.\n-When the cashier said that they are understaffed, the customer changed her story saying he told her she can\u2019t get meat. \n\nIt bothered me how she was trying to get him in trouble for simply telling her he wasn\u2019t trained and she would need to wait.  Here is our back and forth. It only lasted a couple min.\n\n- I said \u201cmaybe we can show him some grace. The deli team member was probably on break. This is the time I usually went on break when I worked in the deli here, and I am surprised you found somebody in produce, as produce and deli team members usually leave 45 min ago.\u201d\n- She immediately changed her story to \u201cnoonish was on break. I asked for meat and he just said \u201cno\u201d and ignored me.\u201d\n- I told her that I just want to check out and she was wasting everyone\u2019s time trying to throw an innocent person under the bus.\n- This is when she pulled \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, I get thrown under the bus more than anyone.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m a teacher too. I know both sides. They have it rough too.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m a preschool teacher, I get less for more work.\u201d\n- \u201cI used to teach preschool too. I got paid $10.65/hour my first year. I know how it is.\u201d\n- \u201cI never got paid that low. And I\u2019ve been teaching for 20 years. I have been thrown under the bus more than anyone in this store.\u201d\n\nAfter this I was hoping to say something that would catch her off guard so she would leave the store, so I got personal.\n\n- I said \u201cI am a gay teacher.\u201d (Yes it\u2019s one of those states) \u201cBigots attack me and throw me under bus just for being who I am and how I was born.\u201d \n- She hesitates before saying \u201cI am a Christian teacher and will not throw you under the bus for what you chose. Where do you teach?\u201d\n\nI cut her off and told her \u201cI don\u2019t believe you and I\u2019m not telling you that. You can leave now, you already paid.\u201d\n\nSadly, she did report it to the manager. So I called back 15 min later and told the manager that she changed her story to get them in trouble. He said \u201cWe know. The team member she complained about was a Team Lead who told her what time the deli would be open again. Thank you for looking out.\u201d  \n\nI tell my students to show compassion and safely stand up for what is right. So I try to do the same.",

When I went in, I thought that\u2019s EXACTLY what I wanted. Now I don\u2019t know what I want.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with me CE for five months now. My last internship was with her. I originally was only in the classroom three days a week for 4 hours. Now I\u2019m in full time. The more I work with her, the more I dislike her. She\u2019s an effective teacher, I\u2019ll give her that, but she spends almost all of her free time talking shit about other teachers and pretending to like them. It makes me anxious thinking she does the same to me. The comments she makes remind me of mean girls. \nWhen she\u2019s mad, she takes it out on me. If a student talks back to her (in an EBD classroom) she will rip my teaching to shreds. I am supposed to be 100% but she won\u2019t let me do anything by myself. She\u2019s always jumping in on my lessons and not letting me manage student behavior. \nI feel like she doesn\u2019t let me learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake during a lesson, she\u2019ll correct me/it for me before I\u2019m able to do it myself, and she does it in front of the class.\nThe kids don\u2019t take me seriously because she won\u2019t let me correct behaviors or teach a lesson uninterrupted. \nShe tells me I need to be more confident but how can I build confidence if she doesn\u2019t trust me.\nMy university supervisor says I am the best performing student teacher she has ever seen. I feel so much better when she observes me, not just because she\u2019s praising me, but because it\u2019s the one moment I have control and receive appropriate feedback. Even when she\u2019s giving constructive criticism, it feels rewarding, like I can improve. When my CE gives me constructive criticism, it feels degrading and overwhelming.\nYesterday she filled an entire A4 sheet of paper with criticisms on a 30 minute lesson. I went to the bathroom and cried. All the other girls in my program say they love their CE.\nMy CE is leaving the position soon, so I am being offered the job. I am not taking it. I made that decision last night and It is refreshing, but I am still dreading the next 2 months.\nAlso, I witnessed my CE do something insanely unethical, the kind of thing you\u2019re supposed to report. She makes me feel so weak and powerless I can\u2019t bring myself to report it. I feel like she gaslights me. I am normally extremely mentally stable and strong, but I feel like a vulnerable puppy, like I can be crushed by this woman. She had my future in her hands. Even though my supervisor tells me how great I am doing, I feel like my CE can snap her fingers and ruin my life.",

        "body": "Hello, I wanted to ask about something! I'm a new English I teacher (taught for 4 months last year at an elementary school but didn't finish the year out so I consider myself a first year teacher still) and I generally let the kids have about 3 - 5 to finish their bell ringer and then we go over it. The whole process takes about 5 - 7 minutes total and it's usually something to keep the kids busy with while I take attendance. At my last school, I was told that bell ringers should not last longer than 10 minutes. I've also been told the bell ringer should not be the introduction to your lesson and just be a little something educational for the kids to do while you get ready (I sneak in grammar lessons that I can't really fit in for my bell ringers normally.)\n\nI have several other teachers tell me they take 10 - 15 minutes to do the bell ringer (as in, the students have 10 - 15 minutes to complete it) and there's another new teacher that says his can take up to 30 minutes. Which is obviously a lot different than how I do things.\n\nSo my question to you is this: how long do bell ringers last for you? Is it just something for the kids to do so they can immediately start working when they get in and keep them distracted while you do other things (like attendance) or is it something that last a much longer time in your room?",

        "title": "Questions about Teach For America",
        "body": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019ve been given an interview opportunity for Teach For America. It\u2019s highly unlikely that I\u2019ll be accepted due to me only being available to work in Colorado. Nonetheless, I do have some questions for people who have experience being or working with Teach For America teachers. \n\nI\u2019ve been heavily researching the pros and cons of Teach For America and if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m seeing mostly negatives. I\u2019m seeing a lot of posts about these teachers having white savior complexes, being unprepared/trained, and pretty much being miserable. I may be delusional but I\u2019m wondering if my life experience makes me a better fit than some of these people.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019d be teaching secondary English Language Arts as I have a B.S. in Technical Writing and a minor in English. I\u2019m also 28 so I\u2019m not a fresh kid straight out of college. I\u2019ve written multiple Y.A. novels (unpublished but it\u2019s my passion and I don\u2019t do it for money/recognition) and I\u2019ve worked with children before (although not teenagers). I helped my mother run an in-home daycare for 10 years, worked as an after school care counselor for a year and I volunteer ran an after school group to help second graders get on track in reading. The group ended up stopping after a couple weeks due to school related issues. \n\nI also grew up very poor in an extremely dysfunctional (as in CPS involvement) family. My father was homeless and schizophrenic, my step dad was emotionally abusive, and we toed the poverty line. The city I grew up in was very affluent (Boulder, CO) though I was living 4 kids and a single mom in a 2 bedroom apartment. I know that\u2019s not the same as living in a dangerous part of a large city but I feel it may give me a slight advantage.\n\nObviously, I\u2019ve never ran a classroom of 30+ teenagers and I haven\u2019t studied education. The Colorado corps does require you to study either a post-bac in education or a masters while you\u2019re teaching. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d be a good teacher though. \n\nI know this is long-winded but will any of this be an advantage to me? I\u2019m not so much concerned with teaching the subject matter. I believe I\u2019d be good at that. It\u2019s more the classroom management, dealing with upset parents, that I\u2019m concerned about. I have a hard time with confrontation due to my childhood. I also struggle with anxiety and very manageable ADHD. \n\nI don\u2019t want to interview if I think it wouldn\u2019t be a great fit because if I get accepted, I know I\u2019d become blind to my concerns due to excitement. \n\nAny thoughts/advice would be lovely.\nHave a great day!",

And they gave me the run down.\n\nSo she returned on Wednesday. Exactly one week after the incident. She showed up to the Wednesday staff meeting. And she wasn't alone. Someone from HR and an asst. superintendent was with her.\n\nBefore the regular meeting began, the principal gave a short speech. Somewhere in it was a brief \"I'm sorry\" followed by repeated remarks about not taking every joke seriously and coming to her directly if there is a problem. Neither HR nor the asst. super spoke up or stopped her. \n\nAt some point in the rant, two of the most veteran teachers grabbed their stuff and walked out of the room. I guess HR followed them out, spoke to them, and brought them back in a few minutes later. \n\nAfter the cesspool of a speech was over she continued to run the meeting like nothing happened. the HR rep and asst. super sat in back watching. \n\nApparently, several people went to the HR rep after the meeting to voice their problems with them going directly to her or that they shouldn't take jokes seriously. They were all told to schedule an appointment to speak to HR if they have concerns. Those same people then went to the principal's office to complain about her \"apology\". She told them to schedule individual meetings with her through \"her secretary\". She doesn't have a secretary anymore. That person resigned months ago and was not replaced due to the budget. The principal forced the front office receptionist to act as her personal secretary. \n\nThis just goes to show that the principal, a recently demoted asst. super, has something on the higher ups or the district itself. Something that is allowing her to keep her post for the rest of the year. \n\nIf she does any other stupid stuff and I hear about it, then I'll share it. I guess the scuttlebutt is that no matter what, she will not be offered a position for next year. I heard she is already applying for other admin positions as they appear online.",

        "body": "This is a rant, I apologize in advance \ud83d\ude02\n\nMy overall summative rating is proficient, but I\u2019m just really upset with some of the things he marked as \u201cneeds improvement\u201d that the last principal marked as \u201cproficient\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d in my evaluation last year. \n\n\u2026 his remarks comment at the end says \u201cthis is Miss Goodsoup\u2019s 2nd year at a Blahblahblah Junior High. She is a hard worker with a postive attitude who gets along with her colleagues. I have concerns about her ability to connect with her students and keep them regularly engaged. Maintaining consistent procedures and student dicipline is also a concern\u201d\n\nFirst I just want to say that I am not perfect by far. I\u2019m a new teacher and I\u2019m still trying out different things. But overall, I have good classroom control, I have class rules and I follow the consequences of breaking them consistently, and I work so hard to make my class interesting (to some at least haha), easy to follow, and well paced. And I engage with my students every day\u2026\n\nAfter my first formal observation this year, I had a meeting with the new principal. I was so excited to talk to him about how the  lesson went, because I thought I crushed it, and I had some great ideas on how to improve more as well. \n\nEvery single student raised their hand during discussion times, students were overall on task during the station a I had them do, and when we came back together at the ends of class to finish off with a creative twist in the lesson, students loved it and some even stayed after class to discuss it with me. \n\nBut when I went to the meeting, he didn\u2019t talk about the lesson at all. The principal spent 45 minutes grilling me about classroom management because at the end of class, one girl called out an answer out loud without raising her hand. The principal asked me who that girl was (and because the meeting was a few weeks later, I asked him to be more specific about who he was asking about.) he said \u201cthe girl to the right with brown hair\u201d, so I asked \u201cDo you mean Abby or Emma? They are both occasionally say things like that and I have talked with them about it before\u201d. The principal asked for their last names and I was sure what it was so I pulled up my seating chart to be sure. The principal was upset about it and said that me not knowing their last names is poor classroom management\n\nI completely understand that I effed up not calling out that student\u2019s behavior at the end of class like I usually would, but I was nervous about the principal being in the back\u2026. And I\u2019m honestly just upset that he didn\u2019t even want to talk about the lesson except to say that it was \u201cgood overall\u201d\n\nAnyways, I guess I\u2019m just ranting because I feel upset that he took one or two minor moments in my formal and informal observations and twisted it as if I am an incompetent dumbass who hates her students.\n\nThe last principal had a reputation for being a hard evaluator, but he gave me a great score and great feedback. Our honest discussions not only helped me see what I was doing right, but the different avenues I could take to improve. \n\nThis new principal is often incompetent/forgetful (even forgot to come to other teacher\u2019s evaluations this year) and constantly cancels meetings on me. I have gotten the sense that he doesn\u2019t like me, as he gets visibly annoyed when I enter the room. But I thought maybe it was in my head\n\nThe official meeting about the evaluation results is on Monday (he had rescheduled me lol), and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I don\u2019t agree with most of what he\u2019s saying, and I want to leave the school after this year anyways (but he doesn\u2019t know that. But I would just hate to sit there and take these punches that feel unjustified/blown out of proportion \n\nThanks for listening to my rant. I had no idea that this year\u2019s evaluations would send me into such personal doubt, anxiety, and confusion. If you got this far, what do you think I should do on Monday?",

        "body": "Teachers, what if I guaranteed I could save you hours of time each week? At Litmus Learn we want to do exactly that. When I taught history, I would assign students open response questions that resulted in mounds of grading. I know there might be teachers that either shy away from longer writing pieces because of how much time it takes to grade.\n\nRight now, Litmus Learn is beta testing one of our latest features - AI assisted grading. We need classroom teachers to try it out and see if it's a feature that would save as much time as we think it will. Our AI assist takes a piece of student writing - even handwriting - and then isolates key words and phrases that you tell Litmus you're looking for in the response. Litmus then highlights instances students use the key words, and ones that might be missing.\n\nWe want our tech to help teachers be more efficient, and more effective. This AI assist is only one of several features we're currently getting ready to roll out as part of our platform here in the US and beyond. But, since it's still in beta mode, it's available by invitation only - not for sale.\n\nIf you're a teacher interested in saving time and testing our beta version, please reach out to me \\[stephen@LitmusLearn.com\\], or on our website LitmusLearn.com  - We can get you signed up for free, and you can start using this and dozens of other features embedded in our Litmus platform. Know a colleague that might like to save hours of time grading?  Feel free to forward this message. We want to help as many classroom teachers as we can, because we know how valuable- and stretched- their time is.\n\nCheck out the video to see our AI assisted grading in action - [https://youtu.be/EYraOn\\_SpJI](https://youtu.be/EYraOn_SpJI)",

I calmly told them we'd talk about it when we get back to the room. We walk back to class and I keep all 3 boys in the hallway while the rest of the class goes in. There was no way I was letting him back in my room.I looked at the 2 and explained the seriousness and asked them again if that is what was said. Then I asked the perpetrator if that is what he said. He did. I am grateful that my aut para was heading toward me. I told her I needed her to take the room. I marched them all straight to the office and got admin. She took over. About 30 minutes later she comes for the backpack. I get a call that it was a very bad joke and the student will spend the rest of the day in the office and to send some work. Guess who was back in my room by 2pm? Why wasn't this kid sent home?!? This is no joke! This is not the first time admin has not taken stuff like this seriously enough.  \n\nI am angry. Before he left for the bus, I pulled him in to the hallway and chewed him out. I live in Virginia. Teachers here are still very shook up about the 1st grader shooting their teacher. I asked him if he hears the news. He sarcastically said, \"Yeah, yeah, the kid that shot his teacher.\" WTF? I am dumbfounded. I plan to send this kid to the office if he even sneezes wrong. I need this year to be over. I am not sure if I can make it to the end. 9 school days until Spring Break and 11 more school Mondays to go.",

My job is a specialist teacher position, traveling between 5 buildings as a 1.0 FTE, and my district does not provide a sub when I am out. There are other aspects of my job that make it hellish, but those are for another time.\n\nI serve approximately 230 students. Of those students, three parents have reached out over my head to complain about my absences to my admins. It is extremely frustrating when I want to be at school, and I physically can\u2019t be. Now I know logically three parents are a drop in the bucket compared to the number of families that have been supportive and empathetic, but classic teacher guilt is making these parents\u2019 words hurt, and I ended up having a severe panic attack yesterday, in the throes of gastroenteritis, just because of these unhappy parents. \n\nI work really hard and I just need to keep reminding myself that I am a human, and humans are allowed sick days. \n\nAnyway idk why I\u2019m posting this, I\u2019m just sad and needed to vent somewhere.",

        "body": "CW: suicide\n\nI\u2019m going to talk about suicidal feelings and one of the main reasons why I am depressed .I'm depressed and suicidal because I'm stressed about school, work and managing credit card debt. I currently work 29 hours a week. I am trying to go back to school after a long break of five years and it is causing me a lot of stress.I have fallen so behind in my school work and it causes me to have suicidal thoughts. I have been trying to get a masters degree for eight years. And because I don't have any motivation it has been harder. My lack of motivation might be due to my depression. I also have a rough time balancing school with work. I am also worried about my mother. She seems to be developing knee problems. She works as a nurse at night and I am worried something bad might happen to her since she is always entering other people's homes. I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels. But I can\u2019t student teach because I have fallen behind on my class readings for graduate school and I still have a lot of notes to study because I couldn\u2019t focus enough on my studying the first time I took my classes. I have always been horrible at studying. So now, I\u2019m in a situation where I am behind in all of my classes even though I have already taken them and got As. I am behind in my classes because I never took the time to really memorize my class notes. I only read through them once. So it doesn\u2019t feel like I actually learned anything in my classes, which is what is causing me depression. I am making a plan to kill myself if my family doesn\u2019t give me more time to finish my masters degree and study my class notes after I pass my mtels. Mtels are exams people have to take to become teachers.I might as well be dead anyways because I won\u2019t be able to afford living on my own. And I won\u2019t be able to pass my student teaching if I don\u2019t have extra time to study all my class notes.. I am dreading telling my mother that I have even more work to do after I pass my mtels. Especially since she has been waiting for me to pass this test for five years. I have to go back and study the class notes from all of my classes that I have taken during graduate school, Which is about 8 classes. Since I have been out of school for so long (ie: five years) I need to refresh my memory.. I'm worried that my mom might kick me out when she finds out that it is going to take me longer to graduate. I don't blame her. I've been trying to get a masters degree for eight years! I started this journey in 2014. She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She\u2019s even suggesting that I cut my hours at work to study for my mtels, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills. I just wanted to talk about why I am depressed. I\u2019m tired of being alive. It feels like there is nothing to look forward too. I will be making plans to kill myself within a year if things don\u2019t get better.\nI think I struggle with adult add. My family is Haitian so it doesn\u2019t really believe in mental illness. I just hate myself because it feels like I have wasted my life because I have never had any motivation to manage it or balance it. That is why I am considering suicide. I am tired of feeling like such a failure especially when if comes to school. I have no idea how to talk to my family about what is really going on in school. I am worried that they are going to kick me out once they find out I will be taking longer to graduate.",

They probably cost 12-16k a student to run that way.  Limited discipline issues,  kids are largely held accountable, kids do well in adult life, and a place for everybody in extracurriculars.\nI always wondered why parents would pay 15-30k tuition to these academies in the metro areas.\n\nTHEY ARE TRYING TO RECREATE THE EXPERIENCE MOST OF THEN HAD IN A SMALL TO MEDIUM PUBLIC SCHOOL WHILE HAVING THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN A POPULATED AREA.\nwhich is not wrong, I get it.  It all makes sense now.\n\nSo instead, why can\u2019t instead of cramming 1700 kids into an urban high school with limited staffing and brag about how we can do it for 7k per student\u2026why don\u2019t we do this for all of our kids?  \n\nGet back to neighborhood schools with elementary schools of 125 or less, high schools 200-300 max.  Put up nice facilities, pay staff well, and have adequate administration to be proactive instead of fire suppression??  \n\nYes it would cost a lot more.  But we\u2019ve created a system again of excellent and poor and it\u2019s all based in income.\n\nThese are just my thoughts on a cold Saturday as I go down a rabbit hole of learning about who Gentry academy in the twin cities is, and so on.  Seems to be a hockey school. Costs 15k to attend.  Happy for them.  A lovely set up.  But let\u2019s consider doing something like this for all our kids.\n\nMy own district in ND spends a lot.  We are rural,remote.  We are small enough to connect with kids and families.  We do not have the benefits of being near a larger population.  But we do the best we can.  Powers that be want a \u201cformula\u201d where it\u2019s a flat payment for every kid and it\u2019s around 10k.  Well, that ain\u2019t enough to do it right.  So in a few year, we run out of kids, staff,money.  The district gets gobbled up by another. Soon they are shoving 400 kids into an elementary after an hour and a half bus ride.  \nThanks for reading the rambling thoughts of an old fart who has given his adult life work in service to our kids.",

        "body": "Currently I'm a first year high school math teacher at an average-performing high school. By the time the kids get to us, their math skills are, on average, so below grade level that doing just 16 problems per week is already a full load for one class. 8 of those questions come from practice problems, and 8 of them come from daily quizzes that they complete on their own. The practice problems are the exact same as the daily quizzes, but with different numbers.\n\nI always get a lot of questions from students on the daily quizzes. Up until now, my policy has been to only answer questions on the practice problems and force them to do the quizzes on their own. But some recent realizations have made me reconsider:\n\n1. Some kids have low math skills but are actively trying, and a lot of them get learned helplessness from trying to complete the quizzes on their own and repeatedly failing. They end up not learning much.\n2. Some kids have low math skills and won't do the quizzes on their own because it takes effort. They also don't end up learning much.\n\nGroups 1 and 2 combined make up a majority of my class. My question is: what would you say is the right judgement call here? If I insist on only helping them on practice problems, their grades will more accurately reflect their learning, but they won't really learn as much because of a combination of discipline problems, not having a solid foundation, and learned helplessness. If I help them on the actual quizzes their grades will be inflated, but they'll learn a bit more despite my doing the work for them because my supervision will ameliorate the discipline problems and learned helplessness.",

In my early 30s just finishing up my student teaching after working with kids for 6 years and intensive schooling for 4. \n\nI have such empathy for those who last in this gig\u2014 I see the constraints, the issues, the lack of validation. It\u2019s fucked.\n\nBut I\u2019m also concerned.. that almost everyone I\u2019ve met or worked with or saw inside their classroom so far\u2026it\u2019s become all about the performance, the perfect organization, the fucking criss cross apple sauce bullshit regiments.  I get that the stress will break anyone. But so many people have lost sight of the actual kids and I\u2019ve witnessed things that would have a social worker report a teacher for abuse\u2026 and it\u2019s just being championed or normalized within a school culture.\n\nOther teachers are catty and shitty about eachothers \u00b4perfect quiet straight lines\u2019 in the halls to the point where the straight lines and the complete silences are badges of honour instead of how to create a dynamic and engaged learning space.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m arty, big on the social emotional and a bit ADHD, but I haven\u2019t seen or met anyone in teaching yet who shares my values. Do we just get branded sloppy and weird and shunned out of schools for being alright with a bit of noise and constructive mess ? \n\nSo far I\u2019ve seen 90% worksheets and it\u2019s killing me. Is this it?",

        "body": "I am looking for any/all pointers on finding a Science Curriculum, specifically grades 6-8. Even just something to point me in the right direction. \n\nMy district (where I am newly full time) currently uses Savvas. My chief complaint with Savvas is extremely strange alignment (hey, let's test a throwaway single sentence from the 2nd lesson on the final test and nowhere else!). In some cases, the bookwork references things that cannot be found in the book at all! I can't begin to understand how students are expected to make that connection. \n\nIt was deemed unusable by our SpEd department and the same concepts taught instead via handouts. The kids understand the concepts but cannot pass the Savvas tests, even with differentiation, due to extreme wordiness and confuaing verbiage. Another issue, which I have not noticed in the Science books, is that the MS history books (also through Savvas) are rife with errors. \n\nWe've only had a small number of students see this all the way through, but they are so soured on Science it's miserable for everyone by 9th grade. The 9-12 teacher is lamenting that the two years she's gotten since total implementation are essentially unreachable or have to be rethought the concepts in a different way. I feel like this is a curriculum-based complaint; I can only imagine the kids are as frustrated as I am. No scaffolding, no way to differentiate without essentially tearing the whole chapter apart and providing info in a different order, using different wording, different work, and different  assessments; at that point, why use a book at all?\n\nEdReports recommends Amplify, which many users seem to complain is nonintuitive and extremely repetitive.\n Our district gives every student a computer, so access via Etext is not an issue. In MO. \n\nPlease offer any suggestions you can!",

        "body": "I just graduated with my Bachelor's (major in English and minor in psych and childhood studies) and I am currently student-teaching and earning my masters in Elementary Education, I chose my university because they have such a great teaching program, one of the best in the country. I absolutely love my school and my 4th grade class! There are 30 kids in my class but they're great kids. If I'm honest, I feel the most like \"me\" when I'm working with my students. I love teaching whole group, small group, and even one on one when I get the chance. Yes, I've had rough days, but overall I'm happy and grateful.\n\nHowever, my Master's program and the gradual building of responsibilities is both stressing me out and mildly scaring me. Between talking to my mentor-teacher and all my university professors/ supervisors, I've learned that the reason why my university's program is \"the best\" is because they push us so hard. Apparently my program puts way more responsibility on the student-teachers than all the other programs. Part of me understands why this program is so hard, but part of me is also wondering if they are intending to burn us out.\n\nIt doesn't help that my mentor-teacher is very much a \"teacher-martyr\". She takes pride in the fact that she's at school 2 hours before the kids are and she stays late every single school day minus days when she has appointments that HAVE to happen right after school. My mentor-teacher has made it very clear that she judges teachers who leave right after the kids. She's always going on about how this is more than just a job or career, and that if you aren't willing to constantly be giving it your all, you are not a good teacher. I've just politely nodded and told her I understand because I don't want to get on her bad side. I'm already worried that she is mildly judging me because I prefer to work on lesson plans and grading at home (which is completely fine under program rules, btw) instead of in the classroom. She supports me, she is a great teacher, and I can learn a lot from her. I just feel very stressed out and overwhelmed by her push to make teaching my entire life.\n\nI guess I just want reassurance that I can still be a great teacher even if I don't spend every waking second devoted to my classroom and my job. I'm not 100% against occasionally staying after or bringing work home if it needs to get done. I feel more comfortable and prepared if I get to school about 30 min before the first kids start coming in to get organized, but I don't want to live in my classroom. I want to have plenty of time to unwind with my husband and our cat at home. I want to be able to get housework and errands done and not be stressing about all I have to do for work. I want to be able to see friends and family now and then without feeling like I'm losing precious time to be doing lesson planning or slide-making or whatever. I've lost about 10-15 pounds since New Year's because this semester has been so stressful. (I am a heavier girl and have been hoping to lose weight, but I was going to wait until the semester ended to make any meaningful changes to my diet and exercise. I was not intentionally trying to lose weight and I know this was not a healthy way to slim down!)\n\nIs this lifestyle attainable as a classroom teacher? Will I be able to set these kinds of boundaries to keep myself from burning out and being miserable? Also, if I realize that the responsibility of being a teacher is taking too much of a toll on my mental and physical health, do I have other options? Could I still work with kids and make a decent salary with decent hours and benefits? Could I find a way to work in the schools and not take work or stress home with me? Does anyone have any words of encouragement for a new teacher who loves her job but hates the stress that comes with it?",

        "body": "I am a freshman in college, majoring in adolescent education social studies and I've been wondering how do I know what to believe when it comes to what I am learning in my education related classes?\n\nI am currently taking a seminar in disability class, the professor is a disabled woman herself. I also have experience with special ed and IEP's as I am autistic and have had to deal with being disabled in the classroom.\n\nWe have been watching documentaries and reading small passages from educators and pedagogy experts. We try to learn from the perspective of disabled people. The class is an intro level class into the topic so it doesn't go in great detail, but from what I've seen, it generally promotes the idea of inclusion, and as a disabled person who had been in disability activism spaces online, I have heard the voices of many disabled educators and disabled former students throughout the years on a wide variety of issues from the social vs medical model of disability to how schools should be run. Because of the spaces I have been in, I have naturally heard more pro inclusion voices.\n\nI also have been on TeacherTok and here and the voices seem a lot more anti-inclusion than what I have learned from my college class and heard from disabled activists (which also includes teachers). If there is mixed data and studies on if inclusion works or not, how am I supposed to know how to best manage my classroom or what reforms to advocate for as a teacher? How am I supposed to know how to treat disabled students, especially if I entered education policy or administration (which I don't have plans on at the moment, but wouldn't rule out education policy in the future).\n\nAlso, are there a lot of ableist teachers? I have never experienced severe ableism by teachers, there have been times where some mildly ableist things were said or done, but very infrequently from my experiences, but I have also heard horror stories from both disabled teachers having ableist coworkers and from disabled teens and adults about ableist teachers. Some of the stuff on this sub has left me confused at times to, like the idea IEPs are somehow being faked en masse or ADHD being \"overdiagnosed\", when in my research those 2 things simply aren't true.\n\nHow do I avoid not allowing personal biases get in the way either? I am not blaming anyone, but as a disabled person, it can hurt to see people use anti-inclusion language because I know what we can go through, I feel lucky because I went to a well off, mostly white district that could afford these things and I come from a well off family and am white. \n\nI also see so many debates on this sub about how to treat trans students, how to deal with gender socialization, how should the justice system and education work, ect. It can be hard to know what is backed by empirical date and what isn't, but even then I've seen this idea that trying to collect empirical data in classrooms on stuff like single sex schools, sex ed, restorative justice, disability, school choice, ect can be near impossible and to just ignore most studies. How do I know the correct classroom management  if there's contradicting studies and people saying that the studies don't even matter that much? All of this makes no logical sense to me and I struggle to know on where to go from here,",

When my mentor teacher is in the classroom the kids will follow her  directions and they will follow my directions if she is within earshot. I have had multiple conversations with the class about being respectful to adults like myself in the classroom, my mentor teacher has also had conversations about being respectful to me once. I am consistent, I am fair, I celebrate positive behaviors, I guide/redirect negative behaviors, I try and make lessons fun and engaging. \n\nMy mentor teacher steps out of the room to handle things else where today without warning and has me take over her lesson that she has planned that I am not prepared to take over. One student immediately became loud, disruptive, and purposefully defiant as soon as she left and the door closed. I know how to be stern and tell him \u201cjust because Mrs.  \u2014- is not in the classroom does that mean you can start disrespecting me or disrupting others learning, you need to stop and continue your work\u201d he makes no eye contact and continues. At this point the whole class is begging him to stop and be respectful. He yells \u201cShutup\u201d at the kids asking him to be kind. I tell him to not use that kind of language. \n\nSome of the kids are so rude and it is unacceptable the way they treat me when they think no one is watching. The problem is this kid who is rude to me has his Grandma, Aunt, and other family members working at the school so from what I observe he never gets the appropriate consequences. \n\nOther students get sent to the office with work, if he gets sent to the office his Aunt in the office will give him snacks and a tablet to watch videos. We are able to over see what they are working on when they are on computers and he begins writing \u201cfuck you\u201d in the search bar. I lock his screen and screen record it so he cant use his computer or erase it. My mentor teacher sends the screenshot to his grandma, mom, and other family member and tells him \u201cyou are no longer allowed on computers\u201d\u20262 hours later he is being told to get onto a computer\u2026 I am just beyond frustrated and I know I don\u2019t have it as bad as others though\u2026just needed to rant.",

        "body": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI coach at the school I work at and the math teacher who coaches our very good track program is a territorial dick any coaches having a team that will potentially siphon some of his athletes away. When his students express an interest in my sport during his classes he will give backhanded compliments or say things like \"so that's where the track rejects go?\" I tell kids that they should do what they're interested in and if my sport isn't their cup of tea it's no big deal. He reserved the football practice field next to the stadium for the first time ever for \"throwers\" despite them already having more than adequate throwing facilities. This is, in my opinion, mainly to force us to practice at the middle school - necessitating students get rides there which will have an effect on participation. He pulled the same thing last year and I only saw that field get used once. \n\nHim and the athletic director went to school together and are good buddies, plus the fact that around 15% of our entire student body comes out for track means that he swings quite a bit of power. I've been trying to get an AED for the field itself since last year. He insists that track have all but one of our district's allocated athletic ones (the other going to baseball) and if god forbid I have an emergency I will need to run into the middle school (around 500 yards away from the field) and unlock 2 doors to use their building AED. He justifies this with \"we have more athletes so we need 3 AEDs\" with his buddy the AD going along with it and saying the current situation is ok as is. Which is baffling because of the extremely rare odds of having three separate cardiac emergencies on any one given day. You probably see my concern for safety when time is precious in employing an AED. \n\nWell this week a very active parent - in the most positive sense - watched John Oliver's segment on AEDs in sports this past week and reached out regarding our team's emergency action plan. I sent her my board approved EAP and mentioned that I had been trying to get a field-side AED for awhile but track has 3 of them and that the AD insists that our plan is ok as is. This mom was justifiably PISSED. She thanked me in an email but went off at the school board meeting. I just got an email saying that an AED has been made available to us for the season and will be available in the future. Superintendent came to see me in person and told me that the track coach told him he was unaware that we did not have a field-side AED and I showed him the emails I sent to him and the AD asking for one and their response of \"we have more athletes so we need the extras more, you have the building AED\". He calmly thanked me for bringing it to his attention, said one would be made available for us, and gave the track coach and AD a major chewing out.  \n\nUsing success flair but I honestly just cannot understand why this teacher/coach would put his ego over something as important as player safety. \n\nTLDR: track coach hoarded AEDs, parent watched John Oliver and raised hell about it, track coach got yelled at, we got an AED.",

        "body": "Me and a few other teachers had a meeting with a parent about a new student we got. This was a tough meeting to have.\nLong story short, without giving away too much personal information we found out that this girl is selling herself for sex. She is in middle school.\nThis is a case where CPS is already involved, although we weren\u2019t told the reason that is. She is living with her biological mom again and not in a group home, which is probably where this situation originated.\nShe has a history of running away from home to go be with older men to get money, sometime for weeks at a time. Measures have been put in place so they know where she is now. She can\u2019t have any technology (phone) and we just took away her chromebook so she can\u2019t email with older men.\n\nNo matter what we do though, she will always have this mentality that she can get what she wants by selling herself. Is there a service we can get her that can force her to go to therapy and work through this? Her mom can\u2019t even get her to go to school if she doesn\u2019t want to, so all the therapy we can offer her at school won\u2019t work if she won\u2019t go. I\u2019m thinking she needs a rehab center of sorts? But this is a lower economic area and I doubt mom has the money to send her. \nAnyone know of anything we can do for this poor girl?",

I am looking for ideas/advice from people who have been in my shoes. After I graduated with my teaching degree, I was working in banking and made decent money. I became depressed and I wanted to do something with more meaning. I was also in a relationship and we shared the bills. Now, I am single and I am on my second year in the classroom. I can't pay all the bills with my teaching salary. I am using my savings account to make it til the end of the year since my school district did not let me quit mid year. I had to take a second job but they don't give me enough hours to make enough. I will resign so I am not going back to the classroom next year, but what jobs are out there that I can apply for that pay better? Thanks for your help.",

Although I see where they are coming from, I feel it is not my responsibility to be the sole disciplinary in their lives. There is only so much I can do with more than 20 other young children to teach and the rest of the staff is too overworked to provide support. \n\nI feel many of our issues stem from not having a policy in writing that makes sense. It\u2019s very vague and doesn\u2019t lead to any real results. We just end up having tons of meetings with the families and taking lots of useless notes that nothing really comes of. \n\nSince we are such a small school, I wanted to know some of your school policies, particularly for preschools or younger elementary schools are. Thank you in advanced!",

I spent my whole lunch setting up the gym properly for the activity, lesson plan was made using all of the \"Excellent\" criteria for evals (even though this principal has *never* given a 4). My class starts to walk in and she's not there. 5 minutes, 10, 15, until the class was over. It wasn't until the next class was already starting that she showed up without an apology and just said \"there was a student in my office\". I get that I know nothing of admin procedures but you're telling me that there was not a single thing that could have been done to 1) Get you or someone else to eval me, or 2) Notify me before that class began. I don't think I've ever felt this mistreated before. I talked with the union and I'm weighing my options over the weekend Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be filling out a job application for literally anywhere else.",

Plus, he has improved (no more physical aggression, now it's verbal aggression/disrespect) so what we're currently doing is showing results. \n\nIs this a problem everywhere?

Repeat and revisit when able). A reward can be positive attention from me, a positive note home, or earning back typical class privileges. Maybe I'm naive, but I also like to think we should focus on the intrinsic reward of participating in a happy, productive, peaceful learning community. No extra prizes necessary. \n\nAre we really at a place where we are just rewarding our worst kids above all the others? Does anyone think this actually works?",

        "body": "For reference, I am a Social Studies Student Teacher in the the Northeast of the United States and we are currently learning about Slavery, Abolitionism, and the Lead up to the Civil War.\n\nSo...today, we were going over an awesome activity that I had put together, in which the students create a \"Twitter\" profile for an Abolitionist to help us get an idea of Abolitionists, and today we were going to do a Jigsaw with the students, in which they would share what they had learned about their abolitionist. It went as well as one might expect for a Six-Week Student Teacher with heterogeneous classes. So, I was a bit defeated, because it wasn't going as well as I wanted. So during lunch I decided to do some work to get me refocused and re-energized. My 6th period went better, and my Co-Op told me to take 7th period, which I was a bit exasperated to take. 7th Period and me have an love/hate relationship, as oddly some of the guys like me, but the girls hate me (because I broke up their friend \"group\"), so I was stressed and worried about it. \n\nBefore we continue, I'd love to say that I'm really passionate about this considering that I grew up near a Civil War battle site, my Grandfather loves the Civil War (and passed it to me), and finally I am really passionate about people in generally understanding the reality of Civil War. So the class starts really good, I quickly take the stage and get them ready, have them prepare to share, and the discussion start to go well. Then during the share out, the group that had [Harriet Beecher Stowe](https://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/harriet-beecher-stowe/harriet-beecher-stowe-life/) shared out that she wrote *Uncle Tom's Cabin*  and I decided to add the fact that Queen Victoria read the book and cried, however I hadn't planned it and figured to phrase it so I accidentally in the moment said: \n\n\"Queen Victoria read his book, and f\\*\\*king cried. Guys! She cried.\" (My first thought was \"Oops. Shouldn't have said that. Ignore it! That did not just happen!\")\n\nI have never cussed before in school, and this was completely out of character for me, in public. I realized what I did and moved to quickly move on and ignore it, but the kids where like \"Did he just say that?\". My Co-Op took over the class quickly and finished them off, to prevent me from messing up further. He told me that I (obviously) cannot let that happen again. I don't know why it happened and I realize that I slipped up and my Co-Op and I are now hoping that we don't get a call from a parent. \n\ntl;dr - I accidentally slipped and said the f-word in class. How do I repair the relationship with the class? \n\nI'm think of two ways I could repair it with them:\n\n1) On Monday, have a closed conversation with them where I apologize to the class and tell them the honest truth\n\n2) Ignore it and attempt to set a better example, and hope they forget it. \n\nI'm thinking about doing 1, but I'm worried that talking about it might have it spill to the administration, both the school and college, and I'm starting to love what I'm doing and I don't want it end because I slipped up and accidentally said the f-word.",

Unfortunately not in a small way, and I\u2019m still not sure how they managed to only give one grade per unit when each unit was supposed to have 6-7 grades.\nIt was big enough that my CT for another class said I needed to loop in admin. I did, feeling so guilty that I messed up by not guiding my sub enough even though I thought I had made it clear. \n\nThen I found the tests. In the stacks of trash scattered across my room, I found one of the 2 assessments. Hadn\u2019t even been touched with a red pen. Looks like the students just turned them in. There\u2019s no way you could look at them and just know what grade it is. He clearly made up the grades or guessed based on looking at them.\n\nI haven\u2019t told admin yet I found the tests but I have a meeting with the principal on Monday to try to come up with a solution. \n\nI\u2019m pissed. Maternity leave is a joke and this guy made up grades and made bank while doing it. Meanwhile I got unpaid to create all the plans to begin with. \n\nDo I tell admin I found the tests ungraded and throw my coworker under the bus? If so, what do I say?",

However, if my school was to catch wind that I wasn't \"living a Catholic lifestyle\" (apparently that's something we are supposed to do, but I haven't found anything in our handbook or in the contract that states that, it's just heavily implied &amp; widely known we are supposed to), can they legally fire me? \n\nAlso, if I agree to do a summer camp but haven't signed a contract yet, can they force me to? I've changed my mind about doing it &amp; a friend did that last year and they *made* her do it anyway, despite not having signed a contract. That seems unethical to me but just wondering what grounds they've got there.",

Every year, I have ran into the issue where she\u2019s misinterpreted what the teacher was saying and thought she was in trouble or being yelled at by the teacher.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve had to message the teachers several times about these incidents, obviously some of the teachers are offended. \n\nShe\u2019s had the same issue this year. My daughter is ready to leave the program. She complains that the teacher always yells at her, talks to loud and too fast. \n\nIn September, I started using Rosetta Stone at home to support her. I don\u2019t know Spanish and figured this was something I could do to support her at home. \n\nMy daughter tells me she knows some Spanish for math, nothing in science. The teacher swears she understands Spanish. \n\nAfter writing the principal about her wanting to leave the program, I had a meeting with her teachers and the principal. \n\nThe Spanish teacher was pretty obnoxious during our meeting, which made me start believing some of the things my daughter told me. (No I\u2019m not one of those parents that think my kid does no wrong\u2026I know she can be a monster!)\n\nHer math scores are good. They don\u2019t do testing on 3rd graders for science, so I have no gauge of science performance. \n\nShe\u2019s always done exceptional in math, even before Spanish immersion. \n\nI\u2019m concerned, she may be falling behind in science. She\u2019s also to the point of not wanting to go to school. I\u2019m not talking the usual not wanting to go to school. She has been consistently adamant about not going to school and leaving Spanish Immersion since mid January. \n\nThe day after my meeting, there was an incident with her Spanish teacher yelling at her. This time, she yelled in English and there is nothing to misinterpret. The teacher denies yelling at her at all. I honestly believe my daughter and question if the teacher is lying. \n\nI don\u2019t want to jump to this conclusion because I know there are scenarios where kids could blame teacher if they\u2019re having other issues. \n\nDo teachers lie? \n\nHow do I know if my daughter has a horrible teacher? \n\nHow do I know if she actually knows Spanish? The teacher just says she knows my daughter understands her. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to other parents whose kids have had the same complaints.\n\nI hate seeing her suffer and truly believe she\u2019s at her breaking point. \n\nAny advice or insight would be appreciated.",

I am merely looking for advice I can take as a future high school teacher who might have to be teaching this class on how to try and mitigate the lack of engagement. I know it is likely a losing battle these are second semester seniors looking down the clock till grad. \nMy mentor teacher merely said you need to realize your demographic and pick your battles which I get but I feel like I could do more to at least TRY and teach these young adults. My ideas were along the lines of cell phone cubbies where they are checked in at the start of class, making sure earbuds stay out and have that be a well established class rule. Would these work?

        "body": "High school teacher here. I've been testing out a promising tool called [One Sec](https://one-sec.app/) which aims to make you more thoughtful about your device usage. Each time you open an \"addictive\" app that you choose, One Sec prompts you to take a deep breath and consider whether you really want to open it - yes or no. The idea is to delay gratification - by just 5 seconds. One Sec is a Chrome extension, iOS and Android app.  \nA [peer reviewed study](https://one-sec.app/max-planck-study/) showed One Sec reduces social media usage by 57%. It was first created by a redditor two years ago and I'm not being paid to promote it. In fact, I use it to target my reddit usage and it has been effective for me. I realized that about half the time, when I click open reddit I have no intention of doing anything in particular, and when prompted to take a breath I realize I'd rather be doing something else with my time.  \nSome ways we might use One Sec with our students-\n\n* If you see a student being distracted by one app or site a lot in class, suggest they try One Sec targeting that app\n* If you see phones so much you're confiscating them repeatedly, offer One Sec an alternative to confiscation\n* Speak to parents/guardians about having their child try One Sec\n* Think about who this could help. Probably for students who are conscious about their desire to focus more on their studies, and would voluntarily try the app. But I'm not sure.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\n* One Sec requires some device permissions to use. One Sec \"draws over\" other apps and it monitors your usage of all apps on your phone in order to do its job.\n* One Sec does not have advertisements. The free version lets you target one smartphone app, or unlimited websites on a computer. \n* There's a paid version that can target multiple smartphone apps.  \n\n* The \"deep breath\" screen lasts for 5 seconds on a computer, 10 or so seconds on a smartphone. I believe this time length is customizable. And if you switch away from that app before the deep breath is over, it would make you start the deep breath again before you can use the app. \n* The app gives you data about how many times you've tried to open the app in the last 24 hours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else tried this app? I hope to hear more experiences of how it works for a younger audience. It was not designed specifically for kids.",

This has affected my sleep and just overall mental health. Of course I cant share my problems with my students but I\u2019ve been making mistakes, not while explaining a concept or anything, but when I help them when they solve their packet. For example, I told a student his solution was wrong yesterday. While his final answer was wrong the working was right but I read the question wrong cause I was so out of it. Today, I told another student his solution looks good when there was a mistake I didn\u2019t notice and it looked right to me at first glance. One of the smartest kids in my class pointed out the mistake he made and I\u2019m like DUH. \n\nMy students are perfectionists and high performing. I teach gr 12 calculus. While they have a lot of respect for me, they were looking at each other today like you made a mistake again?! I feel so bad about myself. I do tend to make careless mistakes here and there. I have ADHD and tend to do things super fast. I feel such a judgy vibe when I make a mistake and It makes me feel awful. Do other high school math teachers make silly mistakes? How do I avoid that? I work really hard and I\u2019m always on my feet helping every single one of them. If I take my sweet time with every step they take (which is what they want me to do) we will never get through the curriculum. I\u2019ve been teaching high school for only 4 years so I guess I\u2019m new. Is this gonna get better with time? How do I keep my credibility when I make mistakes? Any input or advice is welcome.",

Grades were due that following Wednesday, monday and tuesday were snowdays and internet was spotty. My VP asked me why I didn't stay after work to finish grades and in my official memo wrote \"Mrs. B chose not to enter grades due to wanting to spend time with family after work.\"\n\n3) I was put on a PIP plan after teaching for two months. Principal started coming into my class almost every day. I was written up for not checking my e-mails enough, for not walking around enough (again, I had a doctor note saying that I could take breaks as needed due to being pregnant and in therapy)\n\n4) Finally, in march during my MATERNITY LEAVE (I was 6 weeks post partum) I was asked to come in to school so my principal could chew me out, tell me I was in the wrong profession and regrets hiring me in front of our HR president. I was in tears. \n\n5) Then, I was \"let go\" soon after. Only to be RE HIRED because of Covid. (In the official e-mail, it stated, Even though we decided to make you non-renewal, due to these unprecedented times, we would like to ask you to stay for the 20-21 school year.) I should've left. Seriously. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a list of other things that happened. It was not a good school.\n\nI have since left that school and am now in a fantastic school that makes me feel valued. I'm going on my 7th year of teaching and love it. \n\nSo if you're reading this and you're currently in a similar situation, GET OUT. Don't tell yourself it's going to get better and you can prove to them you're a good teacher. Once they made up their minds, you can't change them, no matter how hard you try.

Then they all started using it as an excuse to call off, saying they had chemo.\n\nOf course, they didn't and got fired for not having notes, per company policy. But they think it is hilarious. They bragged about using their \"cancer\" to guilt trip their former managers and one even used it on her customers to get more tips. These girls can not stop laughing about this. They think it's all hilarious.\n\nWhile they're laughing about it, I'm on the verge of tears. My latest blood work and scans said my masses are just cysts, not cancer, and we can work on treating them. I have one the size of a golf ball that was concerning, but the blood work says I'm okay. And here these girls are, making jokes about something I have to get tested for twice a year. I don't tell my kids every time I have to get tested for cancer because it's none of their business, but I still can't help but feel bullied.\n\nWhoever said they are soulless sacks of shit, you nailed it.",

        "body": "32 years old. Was a classroom teacher for 6 years and then an assistant principal. Both at the high school level. My district had to cut 150 principals and I was one of them. That was 2 years ago. Since then I moved and went into business. I\u2019m in medical sales. Doing very well, but I can\u2019t help the feeling that I want to go back into education. The area I reside in lays teachers really well, so jobs are slim. I ultimately want to end up in admin again, but know that I will need to start in the classroom and gain the trust of the new district. Which is fine. There are really hard days in Education, but there is something pure about it that is lacking in the business real. It\u2019s all about making money out here and I\u2019m tired of having a bigger purpose. Has anyone gotten out of education to come back later? How did you go about explaining your absence and leverage it to your advantage to get back in? Thanks!",

As a sped teacher i advocate for ALL teachers and aides. I can tell you as a teacher i am SICK of the immunity that sped kids have. Im going to be honest. Most of the sped kids i teach should have been kicked out of public school and sent to a facility. As a sped teacher i have been assaulted so many times and admin just look at me like well thats part of the job. NO one at their job should be kicked, spit on, punched, choked or shot at. That 17-year-old could have killed her. We need to take immunity away and stop allowing sped kids to stay in the public school education until they're 22 they need to graduate at 18 like everyone else AND be subject to the same laws as the general Public",

But one day, a particularly difficult student named Jack pushed her to her limits.\n\nJack had always been a challenging student, often disrupting class and ignoring Mrs. Johnson's instructions. Despite this, she had always tried to be fair and give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOne day, Mrs. Johnson handed back a graded essay to Jack, which he had clearly put little effort into. When he saw the low grade on his paper, he exploded.\n\n\"WHAT?! This is a load of crap! You don't know anything, you're just a stupid teacher!\"\n\nMrs. Johnson was taken aback by the sudden outburst. She had never been yelled at by a student before. But she took a deep breath and tried to remain calm.\n\n\"Jack, I understand that you're upset, but using that kind of language is unacceptable. If you have any questions about your grade, we can discuss them after class.\"\n\nBut Jack was not willing to back down. He continued to shout and swear at Mrs. Johnson, causing the other students in the classroom to grow uneasy.\n\nFinally, Mrs. Johnson had had enough. \"That's enough, Jack. I will not tolerate this behavior in my classroom. Please leave and we can talk about this when you're ready to have a civil conversation.\"\n\nJack stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Mrs. Johnson took a moment to compose herself before turning to the rest of the class.\n\n\"I'm sorry you had to witness that. Sometimes people react badly when they don't get the results they want. But that doesn't give them the right to treat others poorly. Let's get back to work.\"\n\nThe rest of the class nodded in agreement, and Mrs. Johnson continued with her lesson. She knew that being a teacher was not an easy job, but she also knew that it was worth it to help her students learn and grow.\n\n  \nWhat can I do now to make this never happen again?",

I can think of many off the top of my head but I feel like they are super general. Examples being low income area schools having less funding for programs,  non English speakers having more trouble excelling, and the issue of COVID and it's impact on schools with technology for remote learning and those who don't. \n\nI was wondering if anybody thinks these are good picks or other areas I should consider? I am a very good writer but, this prompt has me tripped up. \n\nBy the way, I'm 31 and switching careers. I currently work for the federal government in CA but can't stand the non creativity, strict environment, and I can't see any change that I do. I know teaching will have its challenges and hard times but I know the joy and satisfaction it can bring. I coach youth sports and that alone is motivating, stimulating, and challenging.

So, I didn't go.\n\nIt's not until today, half way through the day, one of my students tells me why so many students are absent. A note was found in another class on Monday, depicting a person that had been shot and the words \"everyone will die on the 24th\".\n\nAs luck had it, after speaking to an AP passing through my class and another teacher, turns out our Principal was fighting tooth and nail against the district to include in the email that the meeting was mandatory. The meeting was about the note found. Any teachers that didn't attend were not made aware of what was going on. Only the parents received an email about what was found.\n\nThe district did not allow him to use any vocabulary that prompted urgency or seriousness. I understand it was probably to prevent widespread panic but at the same time, I think we deserve to know. \n\nLuckily, the police visited the students house and he has been suspended, but just....come on.

They represent the [fastest growing sector ](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-490.pdf)of the US education workforce, their ranks doubling in the last 30 years as the shortage of teachers has grown more acute. Many work with special education students, who are now largely integrated into mainstream classrooms, offering academic assistance, life-skills training and behavioral management. Massachusetts paraprofessionals must have a high school diploma in addition to some college credits, or they need to pass a state-approved exam. According to the 2020 Massachusetts Teachers Association\u2019s membership poll, the majority of its paraprofessionals are well-educated: 57 percent have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\n\nYet on their meager wages, few can afford to live in one of the most expensive states in the nation. MTA\u2019s 2020 poll found that nearly 85 percent of its paraprofessional members made $30,000 or less, about one-third the average teacher salary. In some Massachusetts schools districts, such as Quincy and New Bedford, hourly wages for paraprofessionals start below the state minimum wage of $15 an hour because municipal employees are exempt from the law. (Unlike for teacher salaries, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education does not provide the average salary for paraprofessionals in the state.)\n\n**What are wages like for paraprofessionals where you live?**",

No info on what happened yet and I\u2019ll probably only be able to find out via word of mouth.\n\nThat\u2019s not the bullshit part, though. The bullshit part is the fact that the key cylinders on all the doorknobs are only accessible from the outside. You can\u2019t lock it from inside your classroom with just the turn of a switch. In other words, in order to lock the door anytime you may want/need to, you need a key ([here\u2019s a visual](https://imgur.com/a/ITuhuSR)). And, because I\u2019m a sub, I\u2019m never given a key - which not only allows you to lock the door, but to access other buildings on campus. So, the only thing I could think to do was barricade the door with an empty filing cabinet that definitely wouldn\u2019t have worked had this been due to an intruder.\n\nI get that a lot of substitutes can be a nightmare. They\u2019re untrained and untrustworthy a lot of the times. Even so, when I\u2019m waiting outside of a building so I can get to my classroom, the other teachers here have asked me how it is I can\u2019t at least borrow a key \u201csince you\u2019re here all the time.\u201d I just shrug, but I\u2019m guessing either because it would mean they\u2019d have to let all subs borrow a key or they used to only for the keys to end up stolen. Or both.\n\nI understand both solutions could compromise one\u2019s safety. Too many keys stolen by subs would mean too many sketchy people can now get into the school. On the other hand, it means I may not be able keep my students safe if god forbid there\u2019s a next time. I was told to take my students to another classroom if that becomes the case.",

I was studying marketing just because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life so business seemed like the easiest thing.

I subbed in middle schools and elementary schools. I really tried to help students learn and follow lesson plans throughly. I had so many people tell me that I was amazing and the students really respected me. My sweet spot is definitely middles grades. I think I found my true passion. Last year I ended up being a third grade teacher replacement since the teacher retired early. Things went so well, but because I didn\u2019t have a certification they hired someone who did. My marketing job pays great, but it\u2019s not fulfilling. I am wanting to make the change into teaching, but not sure how? Do I get an MAT or a BA? What has better outcomes secondary education, elementary, or middle grades? I know the money isn\u2019t great, but I have a partner that would support me and my decision. Any advice would be awesome!

        "body": "Looking for some insight and some ideas on how to help my struggling kid.  Also wondering if this is normal.\n\nMy 13 year old daughter Anna is in 7th grade.  She is a smart kid who gets straight A's but has always really struggled with math.\n\nAnna is constantly complaining that her math teacher does almost no one-on-one teaching with her students.  Anna says that the teacher purchased some sort of video curriculum and that every single day, they watch a video of someone else teaching them the work, and then they are given a worksheet.  They do a couple of problems together in class, then the rest is homework.  \n\nThe majority of the time for Anna, the problems they do in class are the only ones she gets right.  Every day Anna complains that she didn't understand the core concept of the video, that the videos weren't great at explaining things for her, but when she  asks the teacher for help, she would just tell Anna that she doesn't have time to replay the video and she should go home and look it up online.\n\nWe do our best to try and help her find explanations online but honestly the way it's taught is confusing for us because we were taught a different way.  We frequently get her in trouble on accident by doing the work the wrong way (because the resources we find often teach it differently than what she was taught in class).  \n\nAnna is currently squeaking by with a D average and we are all frustrated.  We feel bad for her.   She has pretty much given up on math.\n\nMy husband reached out to the teacher via email and asked what we could do to help Anna, and her response was that the curriculum was excellent and no other students were having the issues Anna is, maybe we should consider after school tutoring.  He asked her if we could get the videos she is showing so we could work on it together at home, and she said she can't legally do that.\n\nUnder normal circumstances - we would absolutely do after school tutoring.  Her school has offered after-school tutorial sessions in the past where you could get one-on-one time with a teacher who would help with these things.  Anna has been doing them since 3rd grade for math and they have been a godsend.  But, unfortunately, due to covid and a teacher shortage, that program was cancelled this year.\n\nAny advice on where we go from here?  I'm so afraid this issue is going to compound and next year she is going to struggle even more.

I heard talk of districts raising the base pay of teachers but no mention of raises for the veteran teachers. If a new teacher comes in making just a few thousand less than me from the start, I'm definitely out.\n\nAre all the proposed raises really worth it when the students are so out of control? Today, I had a student choke out another student (they were friends just fooling around). I have girls fighting because one told another to move out of the way. \n\nIs the smell of marijuana in the halls first thing in the morning worth proposed raise? I get a contact high just about every morning. I'm sure the superintendent got one too when he walked in the other day.\n\nDoes the lack of drive from the students to do just the basics to succeed worth it? I GIVE my students all the information they need (they don't have to search or think about what they need), let them use the notes I GAVE them and the highest grade *might* be a \"C\".\n\nIs the lack of respect for being an adult, hell, a human being worth the proposed raises? I'm here to help you, give you the resources you need to make it in real life. I give you the food from my lunchbox because the school lunch wasn't enough.  I can't count the number of times I've been called the \"N\"-word by students of color for trying to help them, get them to understand that the real world is not going to be their friend, that they have to be better, to know time and place for \"keeping it real\". \n\nI will say it is not all bad. I have good students who do what they need to do to succeed. But they are few and far between. They are starting to get some of the bad habits of the other students because there is no real incentive to do better.  A person with a passing \"D\" average gets the exact same diploma if you have a 4.0 gpa and straight \"A\"s'. Yes, they have a better chance at college but most teens don't see that far ahead.\n\nSo, are the raises really worth it?",

I gave them a paper about the project which includes the due date and I specifically told them as soon as I give it to you, put it in your book bag immediately. \nThe project was due Wednesday, 2/15/23, and I had a handful of students not turning anything in. I then waited an ENTIRE WEEK (2/22/23) for them to turn SOMETHING in. No one did, so I gave them 0s, and had them get a letter signed stating they never submitted anything and will be receiving the aforementioned grade. \nNow I have a parent emailing saying that THEY (the parent) are hearing about this project for the first time, and that I never sent out anything regarding so. They are essentially not signing the paper because I did not include it in the monthly newsletter even though I talked about it with my classes and they even knew about it before I could tell them. \nWas I wrong for doing the letter and try to hold them accountable?

        "body": "I just wanted to throw in a positive post here. I\u2019m a 2nd year middle school teacher in Denver - became a teacher at the age of 29 after a 6 year communications and media career (newspapers, digital journalism, director of communication). \n\nI hated working from home after COVID and took the Praxis and was hired as a 6th grade ELA teacher at a public charter network. I work at a title 1 school, majority Hispanic and Black students. \n\nIt\u2019s the most fun and engaging job I\u2019ve ever had. I love building relationships with students. My admin are supportive and mirror what I believe should be valued in education (teacher support with deans for behaviors, teacher coaching, no pointless paperwork, feel valued / heard). Our pay is pretty good, they pay for our benefits in full. \n\nI love going to work everyday. I feel lucky I get to be a part of the lives of teenagers - they are such hilarious, fun, great humans who are just trying to figure out how to transition from kids to teens. Even the super difficult students are just figuring out how to regulate their emotions and grow into a person. \n\nI am fulfilled and would chose to go into this job again and again. \n\nI wanted to show a positive story for this sub. The profession is going through lots and lots of challenges, and I am grateful to find a school with values that align with mine. If you\u2019re lurking and scared of the becoming a teacher or feel hopeless, I hope this helps!!",

        "body": "I teach 7th grade English at a fancy private school and have very small classes. One of my classes this year only has 7 kids in it. Sounds great, right? The problem is that students in the class absolutely hate each other. I have an insane mix. \n\nOne student, the most disliked, is a far right political extremist. He has openly stated that girls are dumb and inferior to boys, and he loves Germany and learning about WWII. He is openly hated by every single student in class, even the kindest ones, and is on the spectrum. \n\nAnother student also has severe ADHD and is on the spectrum. He has compulsive outbursts in class, and quite literally never stops talking. His parents are going through a divorce and he is in a lot of psychological distress. He is very mean to other student (especially far right kid) and brings a lot of attention to himself for openly insulting them. I have spoken to administration numerous times about his behavior. It is at the point where I will sometimes just throw him in the hallway with a printed Commonlit while I teach the rest of the class. He has never turned in an assignment. \n\nAnother student has ADHD and is unable to focus on assignments. He has frequent outbursts during class. At least he's great at sports. He's generally liked by his classmates and is actually pretty funny. He failed last semester because he turned in about 10% of assignments. \n\nTwo students, one pansexual boy and one genderfluid student, dated earlier in the year. They apparently went through a bad breakup and will no longer speak with each other. Great kids otherwise.\n\nThe last two kids are very gifted, excellent students that have no real behavioral problems. However, they both dislike far right kid and 2nd ADHD kid and are open about their distain.\n\nThe class has become incredibly tense. The behavioral issues are getting out of hand. One student will say something and it will start a barrage of insults from all the others students. I have spoken to administration multiple times. They've sent kids to the councilor, but it doesn't do anything. I cannot have group work, I cannot have silent reading time without sticking half the class in the hallway. Some students literally have detention for the rest of the semester. No one can move in or out of my class for reasons involving the schedule. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope here. I've taught 5 years and never, ever had anything even close to this. I've never seen children be so incredibly mean to each other. I have never screamed at a class in my first 4 years teaching, but I have to scream at these students every day to get them to stop calling each other idiots and dumbasses. What can I do at this point? Is there a way to take control of this class?\n\nMy other classes are great. My 8th graders reading Flowers for Algernon and loving it.",

        "body": "Hi r/teachers,\n\nSo, I'm a retired military veteran who's studying to become a teacher.  I had a pretty negative experience in the military.  It damaged every aspect of my life and I don't consider the positives of the experience to outway the negatives.\n\nOne thing that's bothered me for a long time during my service has come into greater focus during my student observations and I'm curious to get the perspective of professional teachers.\n\nI've always been aware of various military recruitment programs that target kids.  When I was in school, it was mostly recruiter visits and ASVAB tests.  While I was assisting recruiters I was aware of recruiters going to schools, though I was only sent to the local mall.  (Assisting a recruiter was generally seen as a way to get a little extra downtime and a bonus chance to visit your family.)  It constantly bothered me, but I was never in any sort of position to address it.\n\nNow that I'm observing in a middle school, I'm seeing robust ROTC programs, military propaganda on the walls, about 1/10 students in uniform, ROTC instructors in uniform doing bag inspections, and more.  I would assume that there are also regular visits from recruiters that I haven't been around to see.  I would also assume that this gets even more prevalent in highschool.\n\nThis seems to be a concerted effort to target and prepare kids to join the military.  It also appears to disproportionately target low-income, disadvantaged students.  The military already uses financial and educational incentives to entice those populations as an out from poverty.  Additionally, from my experience, the out is generally a lie.  Unless you're clever enough to join only long enough to get your education benefits and avoid a deployment to a combat zone, it's a net loss.  The pay is terrible, the treatment is awful, and it delays any sort of personal growth.  I was a \"lucky\" limited case where I stayted in for a long time, didn't get deployed much, and was retired early with full benefits due to the mental health issues my service caused.\n\nHow do you all feel about military recruitment and ROTC programs in your schools?",

We will get home at around 9 then I'll be driving home at night on icy roads. It's reasonable to err on the side of safety right? School is cancelled because of it, I live far, and I'm an assistant who does basically nothing.

What do you guys - who carry the experience of online teaching more than I do - suggest that could be improved for schools and classes in general, including classes for adults who couldn't complete their studies during their younger years.

        "body": "Sorry this is long. TLDR: my CE didn\u2019t follow through with a consequence for a student and I felt embarrassed and disrespected because now I feel like I look stupid/dramatic. \n(CE is like a mentor teacher)\n\nI\u2019m a student teacher and have sophomores and seniors. I\u2019m new at this, I don\u2019t know how else to approach these situations. As an autistic person I take rules too literally sometimes and have a very strong sense of Justice which is a struggle at times. I\u2019m working on finding ways to rationalize it with myself. \n\nOne rule that my CE and school has is that after so many times of being told to put a phone away, it gets sent to the office. That\u2019s a rule that the school has and as a teacher there it\u2019s my job to enforce it. But the issue is, is that my CE (who is generally a wonderful person) and other teachers don\u2019t enforce it so it\u2019s an empty threat. \n\nAnyways\u2014 yesterday I really embarrassed myself. It\u2019s not uncommon for my CE was like \u201cwe\u2019re not giving warnings if we see your phone it\u2019s ours\u201d and not follow through with it. But I was in a PD the other day and they really stressed following through with what you say. Theres this kid who we have to get onto multiple times a day and I did what my CE said, I told him to give me his phone and he got mouthy with me so I told him to just put it in the phone pockets and the CE would handle it. I don\u2019t usually like to carry things out so when they act out when he\u2019s gone I just tell him and he takes care of it. \n\nWell this happened, and then we went to lunch. He grabbed his phone and I basically said \u201chey xyz, put your phone back. You\u2019re not an exception to the rules and you know that. CE will say the same\u201d and when my CE came back I said \u201ccan xyz take his phone even though I took it\u201d he said \u201cgo to lunch\u201d not realizing the phone was in his hand. He went to get a note to bring it to the office when he realized and he felt bad because he didn\u2019t know. When the kids got back they spoke in the hallway and the kid got the message that he can\u2019t disrespect me just because CE isn\u2019t in the room\u2026 but the kid still kept his phone. My CE didn\u2019t do this maliciously or to disrespect me but it still made me feel frustrated. Not to mention the snickering of his friends when it happened. \n\nSo I feel like a huge dramatic b*tch and these kids will continue to not respect me because they won\u2019t receive consequences that I place. \n\nLet me emphasize, I think taking phones is not the best rule but it\u2019s the one that is in place. So that\u2019s the rule I follow. I don\u2019t have a lot of say because this is not technically my classroom but never the less I\u2019m still a teacher.  I have ideas of how to better handle the phone thing, but again, just a student teacher.",

        "body": "As a teacher myself and coming from a family of teachers, I recently noticed that a large number of the women in my grandmother's memory care unit were also former teachers. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but then I spoke with my sister-in-law's mother who is also a teacher, and she mentioned that her mother was also in a memory care unit with many former teachers. I'm curious if this is a common occurrence and if there is any reason why so many retired teachers seem to be affected by Alzheimer's or dementia. This topic has been on my mind and I wanted to bring it up for discussion, as I thought this sub would be a good place to start.",

Not only bad because we were \"post\" pandemic and some students were legit psychotic (cue the student who came in nearly every day and cursed out every adult in the room and mom can't possibly be called upon to do anything because he's on a plan and his disability means he can say and do anything he wants.) but for other reasons.\n\n Not only for the insane polarized community that spent an entire board meeting discussing gender appropriation and cancelling woke culture.  It couldn't also be the parent who was so openly hostile to me, as to barely acknowledge me in a group conference and then she grilled me on the merits of my teaching.  This woman was an absolute c.u.n.t. at a parent teacher night-- \"so, are we going to get to this meeting or what (imagine I'm speaking with a parent fyi, who was confiding him me, very quietly, telling me their child attempted suicide the year before...across the room.  \n\nIt was bad for those reasons but also for the two faced Principal who never actually explained what he wanted but would have preferred for me to be a mind reader.  It's not healthy to say this, but were I walking on a mountain path next to a cliff and I should, somehow, miraculously, come into contact with this man and he slipped and fell and was hanging on by a hand... I'd help...but I'd have a solid 3-4 seconds really thinking it over, ya know?\n\n\nAnyway, my new school has done so much more for my mental and physical health.  \n\nIt's not a bed of roses....I've got some psychos but they're a little more muted, a little less hopelessly inhuman.  \n\nYou can tell I'm still bitter about my last school but I can only say this because I have so much more perspective now.\n\nAnyway, tomorrow's Friday y'all.

Where should they start? What should be the cap?\n\nI\u2019m in rural CA as a first year with her Masters, and I\u2019m making 54k a year before taxes. I don\u2019t actually have a problem with this salary as someone freshly out of grad school. However, I do take issue with the steps after this. On average, in my district, you\u2019re only going to increase your salary 2k per year, with the very tippity top step after 30 years and the max amount of college credit being 99k. I think we should cap out *far* higher than this, and our steps should be better equipped to do more than just barely keep up with inflation.\n\nWhen I compare our responsibilities and qualifications to careers of my peers, I think we should cap out somewhere around 180-200k  depending on COL (not over-exaggerating). We should then have yearly raises and bonuses that reflect this larger cap.\n\nThoughts?",

        "body": "I need advice. I feel bad for even asking.  My assignment has been changed every year for the last four years, which has been annoying, but fine. I have rebuilt curriculum every year thinking, well I can use it again next year.I.. then I get moved due to staffing changes. This year I was asked to teach a senior elective \"special topic\" in addition to my core classes.  I just heard that I will possibly be moving again next year due to staffing and new changes in the district. \n\nI have put HOURS into building this course. We have never offered it before, so there are no books and no curriculum, but we needed another elective. I'm literally just a chapter ahead of my kids, because I'm having to build it from the ground up. There is nothing on Teachers Pay Teachers or on the state website that discusses curriculum and ideas for classes.  I worked all summer on ideas and attempting to get the first few units together so I could have some breathing room.\n\nWhen football season was over, all my athletes dropped because they no longer \"needed\" the class. Fine. Not really surprising and there were still a decent number of students left. Basketball season ended and more athletes dropped because they no longer \"needed\" the class. Again, fine. We could function with a small number of students who were having fun. Finally, a core group decided they wanted to start going home early because they were seniors and basically dropped, one by one. School allowed it. If everyone drops, teachers can use the period as a planning period, but I had three students left so that wasn't an option.\n\nThey decided to use my class as a dumping ground for students who needed somewhere to go. I received 3 SPED students in the last two weeks (none of which are seniors!) and a student who had been kicked out of another class. I also have students sitting at the back of the room on computers taking online courses because they need somewhere to sit and apparently my room was suggested. My SPED students are supposed to have a one-on-one helper, but they do not because the person that helps them works the first 15 minutes in someone else's class, then leaves for the day.  These poor students aren't capable of doing the work in this class. I've been told to make copies of the handouts and grade them on participation only. If they try, they pass. The students who have been here since the beginning are totally not enjoying the class now since we've got so much going on in the room. It used to be project-based, but now we're filling in worksheets because it's honestly too hard to do projects like this. Even creating the handouts and slides for each unit seems useless. We aren't learning much because we are being interrupted constantly by someone needing directions to what slide we are on, or someone in the back asking for help on their program! \n\nHere's my question. Do I continue to commit time to this class and work on curriculum, or do I stop? I feel bad for thinking about not teaching this class. However, I do not want to work myself to death for a class that will never be used again. Can I find a way to make this class work? Absolutely. But that's not really my question.  \n\nI teach a full schedule with no breaks all day long and this is my last class of the day. Do I keep doing this and figuring out how to make it work, even if it means I'm up until midnight typing up lessons and doing things nobody cares about? Or do I call it quits and turn the dang thing into a study hall like I feel the admin has already done? I have two other classes taking place on computers at the back of the room that are constantly interrupting and asking questions at the same time I'm supposed to be doing this. I'm not sure what they expect this class to be currently. \n\nJust wanted feedback from other people, and not the voices in my head.",

The lead is someone who has made me feel really bad throughout the whole year and today really hit a breaking point for me.\n\nBefore the year started I was receiving heaps of texts from this person and it was so overwhelming. When I started she was always giving me supplies and I appreciated it greatly!!! But as the year went on I would noticed that she would be condescending and seemed to talk down to me. One day she would try to be nice and then it was a complete switch. She continued to periodically give me t-shirts and other things and it almost made me feel bad for not liking her. I don\u2019t like workplace drama but desperately needed to vent. After talking with my mentor teacher she told that she is like this with everyone. Another teacher who was previously on the team told me that she does this all the time to her and others as well, she just doesn\u2019t let her and sticks up for herself. While leaving our some parts I realized i\u2019m dealing with a textbook narcissist.\n\nToday as we were getting ready for a school assembly, one of my students stopped at a corner where we don\u2019t usually stop and without giving it much thought I told them keep going. When I had turned the corner myself I realized they had stopped because this teacher\u2019s class was walking which I realized at the same time as I did. She then proceeded to tell me that it was unacceptable that they were walking around and I tried to explain that it was my fault because I didn\u2019t see them. She cuts me off and tells me it doesn\u2019t matter and keeps going. I realized that other teachers are watching this and because I knew she wouldn\u2019t let me say my piece I just stopped altogether. She ends by saying, \u201cyou\u2019re not in trouble or anything\u201d\n\nI spent most of the assembly holding back tears. It was really embarrassing to be under minded in front of students and teachers and it really got to me. I\u2019m planning on talking to her tomorrow because if I don\u2019t I think she will keep picking on me. I deserve to be treated as her equal. Yes, it is my first year and while I might not know as much I know that I AM capable of doing this job and I wanted to be treated as an equal.",

Or did you not give gifts to the teachers? \n\nI just do not want to seem like I am overbearing, or doing too much to impress them I guess haha.",

It's in a good district with decent pay and I have a great relationship with admin, but my partner and I are going to be moving out of state (hallelujah, I can finally say goodbye to Texas!) This was my first teaching position and I got the job the same day I interviewed (and it was the first teacher interview I had) because it was late-July in 2020 when more people were abandoning ship rather than hopping aboard.  \n\nI've started applying for jobs for a lot of reasons, not the least because I would like to have a job in my new state before I leave Texas. Obviously, since it's February, a lot of schools don't even know what positions they need to fill for next year, and as a result the job hunt is slow going. I had an interview earlier this week for a school that seems like an amazing fit. They implied I would move onto the next stage of the process, but aside from a few polite responses to my thank you email, I haven't heard from them again. I am fairly certain they are just taking their time because I was one of their first interviews for the position, and they truly have the luxury of waiting for a while since the start of the school year is so far away, but my anxiety is through the roof! I refuse to put all of my eggs in one basket, and I'm still applying to other schools, but I really liked this one. \n\nFor those of you who have more experience with the teacher job hunt, how do you deal with the anxiety of the unknown? Any advice, or even simple strategies to avoid refreshing my email constantly, would be appreciated!",

They also referenced (  I wish I was kidding ) the Cosby show  on why they wont factor in income of parents for what students  will get these vouchers. \n\nTo simplify this you can be a millionaire and get public money to send your kid to private school  under these two bill  .

I'm still a pretty new teacher and my last two schools were not like this. \nI just wanted to share some good news in this world of ours that seems to be getting worse by the day.",

        "body": " Hello,\n\nI was hoping anyone could talk about informal teaching/education? For example, museum education, environmental education, outdoor education programs, online tutoring, etc.\n\nIn my state, to teach in a public school, you need an education degree plus a license. I do not have that. But I am still interested in education and teaching (I got an environmental studies degree). I thought I would never want to teach but the idea is starting to be appealing to me. I'm a married woman well into adulthood, so I can't just move to a different state. Just trying to find ways to make a career without having to incur debt for another degree. In our household, I am really only responsible for my own personal bills/expenses and dog stuff, travel, etc. So lack of a big paycheck is okay.\n\nAny advice, suggestions, reality checks, etc.? All appreciated.",

        "body": "I have worked in the school system for over 20 years and have seen many private companies come in to the school to assist different groups of students.  There are companies that work with 12th graders that want to go to college after high school.  There are groups that work with 6-12 grade students to help them choose a career.  There are counselors/workers that come to work with individual students (usually through an outside arrangement like juvenile court or private therapy).  General assemblies are not really productive so most of the programs only work with students that have parents to sign them up (kinda goes without saying but should be considered).\n\nI\u2019m noticing that there are lots of programs that do the same thing but mostly geared towards students that want to go to college and not much for those planning to enter the workforce or with no idea at all. Some require income verification and others require grades.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question: What programs have you seen that work?  Which ones are your district paying for repeatedly, that do not work?  Which programs do you wish existed?  How or should a child participate if the parent doesn\u2019t know anything about it since not all students tell parents about helpful programs?",

She also made noises to get the attention of another one of our colleagues every time she disagreed with something. It made me feel very uncomfortable. I struggle a little with speaking because it is my second language. I am getting better and better but I still feel like I can work on it. Specifically, I need to work on pronouncing words. There is one other sped teacher who came from abroad and also has an accent. Long story short..should I continue to peruse a degree in special education and credential? Is the fact that I have an accent and struggle at times with pronunciation something I need to consider before getting into a ton of debt I pursuit of a SPED credential? \n\nSide note: teachers, it is soooo soooo important to have students talk during class.

It is scary and discouraging. I have thought about special ed but my head teacher told me that once they put you in a special education classroom, they won't move you out. Not sure if that is applicable towards all schools. I would ideally like to teach K-2nd grade but I am getting a another certification in 1-6 grade because my district wants that in case they want to move you. \n\nI initially wanted to get a degree in speech language pathology but I heard the program is very tough which ultimately made me choose education. I am currently living at home and took out my first loan this year, which isn't too much. I've decided to stick with education for a bit and if I decide to go back to school, wait a few years to save money.

To put it short, boys bring out the WORST in other boys: misogynistic jokes,  pseudo-machismo mentalities, etc. I am NOT a self-hating man, and wouldn't even label myself as progressive, but I cannot take it anymore. \n\nAs such, I really don't think separating boys is a good idea. I used to think that; now I don't. An all-girls education is NOT the same as an all-boys education in terms of the benefits.\n\nThoughts?",

        "body": "So I(21F) start student teaching next year, and I have absolutely no idea what to wear when it gets warmer outside. I\u2019ve done a fair amount of practicums and when I was in highschool I did sports, and we were required to dress up for game day, so I have a fair amount of dress clothes. \n\nWhen it cold I wear dress pants and usually a plain decent fitting long sleeve shirt, or a tank top with a cardigan over it.  I also like wearing a pair of black or grey jeans with a flannel. I usually don\u2019t go too flashy and I\u2019m not a big fan of patterns. I don\u2019t mind basic geometric patterns such as squares or flannel but I absolutely hate clothes with flowers or butterflies on them. \n\nI have a few skirts that I can wear during the warmer seasons but I have absolutely no idea what to wear for shirts. I\u2019m not a big fan of blouses, and as I said I\u2019m not a big fan of flower patterns on shirts. I\u2019m more of a basic color person when it comes to shirts. As a matter of fact, all of my winter tops are basic one or two color long sleeve shirts I found at Walmart. I like them and I find that styling around my bottoms is easier than styling around my tops. \n\nSo what do you guys recommend I wear during the warmer months? Any ideas or advice is much appreciated!!",

He's a white kid and told the black kids \"you n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* don't belong in this school.\" I told mom about all these behaviors until she screamed at me at dismissal and told me I'm unprofessional and she's going to send her kid in with an audio recording device so that she can find incriminating evidence about me and get me fired from the district (apparently it is legal in our state to audio record if one party consents). I have tried everything to reason with this child, positive reinforcement, one on one time, specialized reward system from good behavior, etc. no dice. I am fearful and anxious about contacting mom and admin seems annoyed whenever I ask for their support because this woman is truly insufferable. The kid has counseling support once a week, and is also in a specialized reading pull-out intervention because he is on a first grade reading level. I understand his academic frustration and family situation are contributing to his behaviors, but I feel as though I have done all I can on my end and nothing works. Coworkers frequently stop me to say they're so sorry I have to deal with that child. I'm just trying to figure out how to survive the rest of the year with this kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note - this child has a brother coming up to 4th grade next year. Is it reasonable for me to refuse to have this child in my class due to the threats from the same parent from this year?",

For me to get a job teaching band without marching band I\u2019d have to move far out of state, which I am open to.\n\nAre there any band directors out there teaching without teaching marching band?\n\nHonestly I\u2019d probably do better to just continue teaching myself programming and then gig outside of that job.",

        "body": "Hey everyone!\nI\u2019m planning on doing a multiple subject credential program this summer and I\u2019ve been hearing a lot of different things regarding the CSET so I wanted to clear up some information. I already passed my CBEST but for the CSET, do I have to still take it or can it be waived? I have a BA in English as well and I was told I didn\u2019t have to take it at all and then I heard that I still had to so I wanted to know for sure if I could have the CSET waived before I apply for the multiple subject program. Teaching requirements always change so it\u2019s always good to triple check! Thank you!",

Yes sometimes the kiddos can be kind of hard to deal with but what else should I expect?  It\u2019s the admin.\n\nI won\u2019t get into everything since I have a few posts already.  But I feel so uncomfortable here and like I\u2019m doing everything wrong.  We had a lockdown drill (which I\u2019m new and in every other situation here we were told about the lockdown drill in advance) and someone in admin got mad at me that in 5 seconds I couldn\u2019t get from my desk (at the back of the room), through 36 students, and close the window and lights.  With how loud the kids were today, I\u2019m surprised I heard the alert!\n\nMy co teacher who has more experience than me is absent (hence why they are more unruly today) so I have a sub and she did not know the procedures and my concern was getting the kids where they had to be.\n\nNo wonder there\u2019s a teacher shortage!  Some may think I\u2019m being ridiculous but I\u2019m already treated so badly and I\u2019ve been here a month.  I\u2019m starting to think I should just leave and work at Target or something.  When I ask for help I\u2019m told to do what I just did to diffuse the situation.  But that didn\u2019t work so I\u2019m asking for help.\n\nI have left a few jobs recently (one to leave cause I was miserable, another but it was expected because I would start teaching, the other cause admin thought I\u2019d be better suited for another school), so I\u2019m afraid if I leave again cause I am miserable it will look bad.  I\u2019m not the perfect employee but I do everything I can with what I have.\n\nI wish I could make a living off private tutoring but that\u2019s hard.  I just don\u2019t want to be in a school anymore but I don\u2019t want to leave the kids or co teacher since she has been so much less stressed since I came along and the kids like me.\n\nAny teachers who could tell me what the best thing to do is please let me know!  I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a current or former teacher I just need advice!  And I know talking to admin won\u2019t help because in my experience the boss usually finds a way to blame the employee.  All I ask is to be nice!\n\nI swear I love teaching but I don\u2019t always love being a teacher.",

I figure this is the best time to do it, since I\u2019m not settled in a job or a house. \n\nAnd maybe I\u2019ll like living abroad and will want to do it longer. I heard Japan is a nice place for introverts and the children are more focused on their school. \n\nOr maybe if I get hired for Japan, I\u2019ll decide to do something else after. I\u2019ve wanted to live in Spain for years. I speak/understand quite a bit of Spanish but not a lick of Japanese. \n\nI heard they want to hire young pretty people for TEFL and idk if that\u2019s moreso a rumor. I\u2019m almost 27 but extremely youthful in appearance and get mistaken for being much younger and most people are shocked I\u2019m almost 27. I just wonder how hard it would be - for me too - to go live abroad if I finish school here in a couple years. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth it to go do it now and live my life and not commit/settle to an education career in the US right away.\n\nI don\u2019t want to birth children/raise a family so I\u2019m not in a rush for that haha. Most I want to do, if I can afford it, is adopt a teen and pay for their college or sponsor someone through college.\n\nOr do you think teaching abroad would be too much, since it\u2019s likely I would be placed in a highly congested city?",

I witnessed new teachers be harassed until they had mental breakdowns and gave up.  I remember feeling very insulted and infantilized at the material and worksheets we were given, but I wasn't mad at the teachers because they were clearly overworked and overwhelmed. We had a lot of gym teachers or other not-really-qualified-to-teach-this-shit teachers \"fill in\" in many subjects.\n\nI had a world geography teacher pull me aside and tell me to sign up for AP classes because I..did our assignment \"really nicely\". (Had to colour in a map) I took his advice and it feels like the regular classes should've been what our AP classes were. I had an AP class that didn't feel like an AP class because the students harassed our teacher to the point of tears and she gave up mid year. Bless her heart. I had another told me he was on anxiety medication because of the students.\n\nI went to a different school in a better area and it was even worse. The teachers were lazy or gave up from students not caring. That was really aggravating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my husband's niece was telling me that for her final, for a history class, she is in 11th grade. She coloured in a picture of a shoe\n\nShowed me pics for proof\n\n  \nShowed me pictures of her other work she did for different classes and it felt like she was being taught at a elementary level. They had them play with bubbles on a table?\n\nIt really wanted me to ask y'all what is it like now? Is it bad like this everywhere? What future does our country have if our education system is on fire like this? I feel like you guys would have the best answer for this because you're trying to teach our future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClarification I have a lot of empathy for teachers and I understand you have shit pay and little support so I do not blame those teachers who tried, or keep trying.

        "body": "This is elementary school. Like many of you here, my school is on absolute fire. There are uneven consequences for behaviors from admin (ex. Some kids can kick and hit with no repercussions, others get sent home on suspension), and a general lack of respect. \n\nI refuse to just \u201cchat\u201d with kids when they\u2019re making the wrong choice. Not doing work? Stay in for recess until you get it done. Being disrespectful? Call your grown up and let them know how you think it\u2019s okay to talk at school. \n\nFor a while, this was going well in my third grade classroom. Kids knew the rules and for the most part, did what they were supposed to do. Lately though, there has been a shift of absolutely nasty attitudes in my classroom. Major disrespect, kids not caring about consequences, and just total lack of empathy. \n\nI asked my kids what was going on, and a handful of them just flat out said that they don\u2019t like it when I make them do work, class is stupid and they\u2019d rather be in the class next door (that is absolutely wild and out of control). I think the issue is that they\u2019re seeing other kids get away with actions that I don\u2019t let them get away with in my classroom, and are starting to see me as the bad guy (which, I don\u2019t care lol). It did hurt my feelings a little bit and I think some kids in my class noticed how it affected me (they thought it was funny- like I said, lack of empathy).\n\nHow do I get ahead of this newfound disrespect and unwillingness to comply? I don\u2019t care if I have to get tougher. I feel like I\u2019m on an island of just me and a few other teachers in my school that actually handle behavior and don\u2019t let everything slide.",

My middle school humanities students have been working on a Moth storytelling unit. They, and our entire elementary school, have worked hard for 2 months preparing, practicing, and revising their oral stories. They were so good! Today was suppose to be the performance. We had a sweet hook up at a local theater with full access to their lights and sound tech. Parents and caregivers were gonna be there. It was gonna be a big celebration of student work and dedication. Now, instead, we have to reschedule and we lose access to the theater. We will still perform the stories but just in our gym with a simple mic set up. Not the worst thing ever but I\u2019m really bummed to lose such a cool opportunity for my kids to experience at a real theater!",

        "body": "Full disclosure: Not a teacher, 24 y/o in completely different field, that enjoys perusing this sub.\n\nI am shocked at reading a lot of these stories and than realized I see a lot of the same behaviors in adults as well (myself included). Not exclusively young adults either, all ages. For some reason, our American society is at a point right now where we are tending to be very lazy, addicted to our electornic devices and rebellious of any and all authority.\n\nI feel like the work from home \"revolution\" recently is hugely indicative of this. So many employees outright refusing to go back to the office and threatening to quit if they are made to. There are also entire Reddit threads dedicated to \"how do you keep your work computer active when you're not working and what activities do you do instead of working.\" I'm saying this as a person who works from home and know others who do, I do not believe for a second people are just as \"productive\" when working from home like many claim to be.\n\nJust that one instance pretty much hits upon all of them. Want to work from home because more down time (laziness), will rebel and/or quit if forced to go back to work (rebellion), and when working from home almost certainly on an electronic device all day and plus very antisocial since you're not talking to anybody. Which is another issue I think is up with students nowadays, they don't interact with one another anymore.\n\nIt always makes me sad whenever walking through somewhere and everyone is on their phones, and yet it happens everywhere. I'm the same way, I'm on it way too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIDK what the solution is other than its honestly a problem for a lot of people right now, not just students.\n\nI think part of it is the \"predictability\" of the world/future has become much more variable in the past years and people are quickly questioning the notion that you can \"work for everything you achieve\" and realizing that's not really the case. I'm sure there are many other causes than that as well.",

In order to make 1 person not stand out, everyone else loses something that they personally have a stake in. I can't get into specifics but this involves some essence of time and money that they're giving up.\n\n\nThinking about it, this kind of sums up education in a nutshell. A lot of times policies are created for a handful of kids with a majority taking a backseat to the repercussions. I find it to be the easy way out; a half ass approach to a complicated problem.",

Second kid hit me with object that he kicked towards me and admitted it to admin. Kid included the phrase \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t that hard\u201d Multiple times. I was told to document and call home. Nothing else was done in either case. Lastly, I can\u2019t join a union yet since they aren\u2019t taking members till April for the next school year.

The bathroom doors are locked, so everyone needs to be standing in line waiting to go to the bathrooms when we take a break, so by the time everyone goes, that leaves them with like 3 minutes to actually play. \n\nI\u2019m so infuriated and I know it is so wrong to not give them any breaks throughout the day. I don\u2019t know what to do since they are really cracking down on this policy, and seem to encourage no recess at all. Even kindergartners only get 10 minutes. \n\nI really want to bring this up with admin, but I don\u2019t know how. Usually their solution to any concerns the staff have is \u201cstop complaining and be positive.\u201d \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

It's even harder when it's multiple students taking part in the same lie and you feel like the crazy one. Today 98% of the 7/8th grade class was ready to start at the bell. I constantly have two students who are always socializing with each other and/or harassing students/being nosy standing in the doorway. I try standing in between them, closing the door early, \"please take your seat\" multiple times, etc. I'm out of ideas. \n\nToday I yelled, \"\\[Names\\] will you please get away from the door and sit down!\" \"We weren't at the door, I was throwing something away!\" They were clearly in the door for the entire start of class and ignored all previous reminders to sit down. After the call out and the back and forth over the delusional lie, they did sit down and comply. Phone calls home, mediation, and referrals to admin have not improved this behavior. I am also afraid that the other students will follow suit and I will eventually lose control of my class.\n\nAt the end of class, I asked my teaching assistant (an 8th grader I had last year) what it is that I am not seeing but a kid might. She said, \"I know you probably go home and ask yourself what you are doing wrong but you're not doing anything wrong. It's them and they are never going to change.\" \n\nAre there any creative ideas on handling students like this so I can at least feel a few steps ahead in addressing the behavior?",

It is SO MUCH work that it can feel overwhelming. \n\nBut, I miss it. \n\nI left teaching this last September and transitioned into another career field. However, I miss the mayhem of the classroom. I miss all the personalities and random moments of \u201cI cannot believe this is happening right now. Is this really my life? I went to college for this!?\u201d\n\nCorporate world is OK. It\u2019s lower stress and I definitely have more flexibility with when you can take breaks. For some, I can definitely see the appeal. But I will say, there is a lot to like about a career as a teacher. \n\nFor me, the pay is absolutely a pro. I worked my life as a server, so making 57K was a dream come true for me. It is challenging to match that pay in another field, especially starting out. \n\nThe schedule is fantastic. I mean, once you are able not devote so much of your off time to the classroom. After that, working 7:30-3:00 is awesome. \n\nI was proud of my role and felt I could make someone\u2019s day brighter. This can be achieved a lot of places, but it definitely feels more authentic than in the corporate world. \n\nTruth is, many people leave education and are satisfied. I just wanted to offer some reconsideration for anyone who is pondering leaving. I think teaching is worthwhile and I miss it every day.",

As a professional courtesy I left her know 2 months in advance that (if possible) due to me running state testing for 600 plus students at my campus- to please schedule my IEP meetings for before 8 or after 1:30 PM. \nAll of a sudden my TEAMS started blowing up with back-to-back phone calls from someone I did not know. I was with a student and couldn\u2019t pick up right away. I even messaged him that I would call him in a few and he still continued to call me. All of a sudden it was this older male yelling at me. I was taken back and he proceeded to berate me that state testing is not important and using all these wrong terms of it being illegal for me to ask for IEPs to be set in a certain timeframe. Coupled with \u201cI don\u2019t do that much\u201d for state testing and wanted to know my responsibilities. I was hired by our state testing team for this huge task. I am responsible for students 3rd-12th grade. Along with any campuses near me. I have to make the schedules, drive 1.5 hours to retrieve state testing items and then return them 4 times a year. We have Winter, Spring and some summer testing windows. Everything is on me and my certification if something goes wrong or if the state comes in to audit. I never met this man before and directed him to speak to the person that hired me. I was in shock- I have been teaching for 10 years and have a masters in educational leadership- I was horrified how I was spoken to. How asking something so simple turned into something so dramatic. Mind you- I might have 3 IEP meetings due in that month of testing.",

Is it reasonable if I add another test for him on top of yesterday's test for him to be able to go for an outing? Or that will be like moving his goal post?\nI'm thinking of doing that because I believe he will get it all correct for yesterday's test way earlier before today's class ends. And if that happens, he will no longer have motivation to do his work properly for the rest of today's class because he is getting what he wants already. I hope I made the issue clear. \ud83e\uddd0",

        "body": "I recently applied for some tutoring positions at the company but now I'm starting to have second thoughts considering the low pay per hour ($15 an hr), complaints about crappy service, shady advertising tactics, and company practices (apparently they overcharge students, then keep most of the gains to themselves while giving the tutors garbage), and a class action lawsuit that was filed in the state of California because of the company treating its tutors like independent contractors when they should, in fact, be compensated as employees.\n\nAs someone who knows next to nothing about the tutoring industry, am I making a mistake by working for Varsity? Want to make sure I make the right choice before I dig myself into a hole. What's your opinion on online tutoring businesses general? Are they reputable or mostly scams?",

        "body": "Today at my school I unraveled a cheating scandal like no other. Which I have to admit was pretty clever and well thought out or at least it was. I have a very under preforming class. We are more than half way through the 3rd quarter and this class has fallen off the wagon. Over half the class has a F due to some FIDs (flexible instruction days used to replace snow days) the students refuse to make up over 6 assignments at least the half that are failing. But other wise are a B to C avg class if they weren\u2019t missing 120 points. Well last week I have an assignment as I was going to be out due to a funeral (I\u2019m okay it was for a very distant relative) The assignment was simple. Read a 20 page intro to a history topic. Then write a 200 word summary on the readings. As I was in Philadelphia awaiting the funeral I noticed  that this class finished the assignment in one day in one class period (44 mins) I expected them to take 3 days.  Which was an immediate red flag for me as my honors section of this class had zero students finished on the first day. I brushed it off I had things to attended too and I took the days off I\u2019m not worrying about school. I came back on Monday. After finishing my mid term reports on grades. I had a chat with this class about the low grades and how things will be changing. Tuesday passes and today I decided to finally grade those projects and what I discovered next was truly amazing. \n\nThe first student I checked cheated 100% copied and pasting the source I gave them as their own summary and feelings. But it was weird because they like Frankensteined it buy coping the paragraphs out of order. Simple 0 out of whatever and a write up. \n\nBut that\u2019s when it started\u2026.\n\n7 more students in a row coping and pasting the same paragraphs in different orders. I knew something was up and then I wondered into student number 9\n\nThis student posted word for word the first page of the primary source I told them to read up to 500 and some words way over the 200 word minimum. \n\nI knew it was copied and pasted right away as I\u2019m very comfortable with the source material and it was word for word the first 500 and some words but at the end of the paragraph sat and very beautiful discord invite link. (I assume this is what they started it with and shared it with friends and someone didn\u2019t erase the invite)\n\nI joined it, I\u2019m the esports coach at my school and there\u2019s only 10 PCs that can access discord. Because you need an admin password to download it. Another great touch is no underclassmen are not allowed their phones during the day.  So I had unlimited access to the whole discords and all the information that was there. They were cheating in my class and only my class for the last 5 weeks. I took screenshots of everything.\n\nThey had no idea until 3:00 as I saw everyone leaving the discord in a massive wave. The admin knows. The kids either know or think I\u2019m another student named my name (as if someone copied my teaching account to scare them.) \n\nI stayed an hour late to write all the DT forums and tomorrow I\u2019ll confront them. Truly amazing. 9 write ups in one day. A new personal record. \n\nIf you\u2019re still here reading thank you I hope you had a laugh like I did.",

I played a new review game today that I haven\u2019t played before, called hot seat. It was sooo much fun and the kids did great with it. It really showed their knowledge on vocabulary and formulas! So I made 2 teams, one from each sat in the \u201chot seat\u201d, a chair, infront of the board. On the board, I had wrote a term for review (this is good to differentiate for learning levels, using difficult terms vs easier elementary terms) For example, coefficient. The two in the seats could not see the word behind them. Then one team\u2019s members would raise their hand and once chosen: try to describe, define, provide an example, or explain what the word is so that the person in the hot seat could guess the word. If they missed it, it went to the other team. If the person got it right, they got a point and then another team member took their spots. I was so amazed at how well they knew the words! Some I heard for coefficient was \u201cthe number next to the variable\u201d or \u201cif you have 7x, its the 7\u201d. I was like okayyyyy! They struggled with vertices though\ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m like, how many times have I told y\u2019all what that means!!!!! \ud83e\udd23 and it made them memorize their formulas too. I was impressed \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019m going to play this all the time now with vocabulary and formulas!!! If you try it, let me know how it goes!!:)",

It\u2019s helps me to effectively manage stressful situations and make better decision under pressure. It also allows me to be more compassionate and less judgemental, which are useful skills when it comes interacting with students and colleagues. However, these are just a few of the benefits of a daily meditation practice.\n\nI feel that meditation is the key in allowing me to be my best self both at work and in my personal life, and I struggle to imagine what my life would look like without it.\n\nI'm making this post to see if there are any other teachers out there that practice meditation. If so, I'd love to hear about your experience with it and its affects on your career.\n\nIf you've never tried meditation but would like to give it a try, leave a comment and I will start a separate sub where I can share best practices and help you to get started.",

        "body": "Coming onto the internet to ask strangers for help is hard, but I could really use some advice on this situation! I studied elementary education and recently graduated. Been working as a Flight Attendant for the past 6 months and was waiting for schools to open up hiring. Being a teacher is something I've wanted to do, but the pandemic has really thrown a rut in things. Needless to say, I got offered a job at a S.T.E.M. school that recently expanded their campus to having a K-5. This is the school's first year with these grades. \n\nThe position I was offered was for 5th grade and not all of the details of the job were revealed to me. Instead of starting next year, they wanted me to start immediately. After three days on the job, both of the 5th grade teachers resigned over the weekend. No warning, just left. Supposedly they bashed heads with admin and there was something going on with students who had IEPs. I am panicking as I was left with no mentor teacher, a 5th grade in shambles, and seven kids have already withdrawn.  Is it worth sticking it out for the rest of the year and to start fresh next year? Or is this a sign to run for the hills? I truly want to give it the effort it deserves, but I am not working with much. No one knows where the kids are in the curriculum and the teachers took everything with them and said nothing. I still have my Flight Attendant job which I enjoy. The teaching position pays a bit more, but I am due to get a pay bump in four months. Pay difference is teaching (50k), flight attendant (35k first year, 40-45k second year). Any and all advice is appreciated.",

Basically, my program is not providing any help and I no longer work for a school district so im unable to record my lessons. I cant sub due to not being able to take time off my job due to financial issues. I was doing some research and learned that I would be eligible to obtain a teaching credential in Arizona. Would it be possible to get it there and then transfer it over to California? It seems to good to be true to play the system like that so im not sure if its actually possible. Also, I have no plans to move there or a physical address there and idk if that would be an issue. Has anyone ever tried this or have any insight? its been a stressful last 2 years for me going into more debt for my credential and not be teaching yet.",

That we don't also get bored, need to stretch, etc?\n\nI bring this up and she sort of nods along, but I wonder how prevalent of an issue this is. How many other of ya'll have the weird irony of being told during a 2 hour long meeting with no breaks how important it is for the kids to be getting periodic breaks from monotony?\n\nAt one point she had experimented with 3d printing some fidget rings for herself and got some measurements wrong, so we ended up with a handful of extras so she took them to work, and apparently she brought them to the meeting and they were a hit, and soon all her fellow teachers had fidget rings on for the meeting. Now I'm getting some requests to custom make more for the crew lol\n\nIt really raises questions, in my opinion, about how many *other* gaps there are in teachers failing to practice what they teach.

        "body": "Background: High school teacher who taught the same kids for two years. They've moved on now and I'm in the same grade they had me last.\n\nHere's my conflict:\n\nLast semester, one of my current students came to me and told me one of my former students was making extremely inappropriate comments about me and him having sexual relations. I was extremely disturbed by this but the student who told me this is a known troll in my class and no other kids mentioned this. I'll call the former student Sean and the troll student Luke. \n\nNow I had Sean for two years and never had any students come to me and tell me he made these comments before. Luke frequently antagonizes his classmates and likes to talk to me about his exploits of the day (even though I discourage it every time). So when Luke told me Sean said these things, I genuinely didn't believe it. Fast forward a couple of weeks ago, Luke comes into my room with two other students to tell me about comments Sean is making. \n\nWhen I had two additional students come in, I immediately informed admin with these students because I believed those students. However, when asking for the source, one student said that Luke told her what Sean said, and Luke told everyone he heard it straight from Sean. That was a red flag for me immediately, but in that moment the event was officially in the administration's hands and I was too upset because now more female teachers had been included in the rumor. \n\nNow, that should've been the end of this story until today. Luke sent an email to one of my colleagues apologizing for all the other things he has done and lied about. He said in this email though that he never said anything about having sexual relations with myself or any of his other female teachers. Even before this email, I was worried about Luke because after Sean was kicked out, Luke came to me and asked me about what happened next. Luke had a smile on his face and I genuinely, in that moment, felt like he had set Sean up to get kicked out. Luke spoke to OTHER kids about what Sean allegedly said and Luke is the only kid who's openly admitted to hearing Sean say these things.\n\nI don't know why Luke targeted Sean and tied Sean to me specifically (I don't have Sean as a student anymore after all) but it just makes me wonder and to be honest, it makes me hyperaware of Luke now. I'm not gonna lie, he genuinely makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAm I overthinking things? Do yall think Sean was set up? I'm not going to pretend Sean's a perfect kid because he absolutely isn't. He honestly had the expulsion coming but I don't like the possibility that the tipping point might've been a lie. If it was a lie, what's to stop Luke from implicating another student? \n\nI'm just feeling uncomfortable about this whole situation.  What do yall think?",

By the end of the assignment, students should be able to identify different types of pronouns and use them appropriately in their writing.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Start by defining pronouns and explaining their function in language. Provide examples of pronouns in sentences to illustrate how they replace nouns and help avoid repetition.\n2. Introduce the different types of pronouns: personal, possessive, demonstrative, reflexive, relative, and interrogative pronouns. Explain the function of each type and provide examples of their use in sentences.\n3. Have students complete a worksheet that includes identifying pronouns in sentences and choosing the correct pronoun to use in a given sentence.\n4. Assign a writing exercise in which students write a short paragraph about a person or object of their choice, using a variety of pronouns correctly. Encourage them to use different types of pronouns to demonstrate their understanding of their function and usage.\n5. Hold a class discussion on the importance of using correct pronouns, particularly when referring to individuals whose gender identity may not be immediately apparent.\n6. Finally, encourage students to practice using pronouns correctly in their daily conversations and written communication.\n\nAssessment: The students will be assessed on their ability to correctly identify different types of pronouns, use them appropriately in sentences, and apply this knowledge in their writing exercise. They will also be evaluated on their participation in the class discussion and their ability to use pronouns correctly in their daily communication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to use in your classrooms!",

        "body": "TLDR: I\u2019m sick and am only getting sicker. I can work, but I can only work. I spend the rest of my time lying down or in the bathroom in pain. I don\u2019t want to lose my dream job but I also don\u2019t want to lose my 20\u2019s because I can\u2019t take days off for appointments to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\n\nHi everyone, \n\nI am a 22F high school art teacher. I got my gig right after student teaching here- a perfect opportunity and honestly what I thought was my dream job. And it would still be, if I felt alive enough to experience it and put my heart and soul into it.\n\nPrior to this, I TA\u2019d and taught at an alternative behavioral school all through college. I also taught after school art classes for a few years. So, I\u2019m a first year teacher but I definitely understood what I was signing up for. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m quitting because I don\u2019t have what it takes, but, it kind of is.\n\nDuring my student teaching I started getting sick. In these past two ish years it has only gotten worse. Debilitating, in fact. I\u2019ve had to take a days off for a colonoscopy, and have had three ultrasounds since starting here. I go to work every day in severe abdominal pain, but I\u2019ve only taken off one day when it was just too much. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I go to bed around 7 pm every night. I am so, so tired no matter how much I rest.\n\nBut, I am a great f*cking teacher. If you saw me at work, you\u2019d have no idea I was sick. And that\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m putting off tests and treatments because I can\u2019t afford losing my job for taking more days off because of appointments or for side effects of medications.\n\nI am 20 effing 2 and I feel like a living dead person. My only human hours are putting on an amazing show at work. But, I can\u2019t keep up. I often spend my preps lying on a table in the back of my classroom.\n\nI don\u2019t want to quit after 1 year. This is the perfect job opportunity. I even scored the perfect apartment this summer. The thought of quitting and moving back into my parents house with no income to help them and living off of their health insurance is embarrassing and so frustrating. This was supposed to be it for me. My career. My life. \n\nI could probably work next year. Probably will. Maybe something will change for me this summer. I\u2019m just so scared that I\u2019m letting things get worse and losing my twenties just to keep a job. I\u2019m so lost. I\u2019m the decision maker at work for others, but I can\u2019t fathom making one for me.\n\nI apologize that this is so long. I\u2019m also on mobile. I also know that teachers teach while chronically ill and I am not trying to say I have it worse than anyone already struggling. Because I\u2019m young and my mom has great health insurance from her job, it\u2019s definitely easier and more privileged for me to even get the option to make a decision.. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what kind of remote job would exist for me. Any tips would be helpful, and any advice or stories from other teachers dealing with any illnesses would be nice. \n\nThanks for reading :)",

        "body": "I wanna preface this by saying that I have perfect attendance in a school where teachers are routinely absent and the subbing list for classes is usually very long on the daily. A very close family member was admitted into the ICU in the weekend following very sudden sepsis. I emailed work to let them know I might need 1-2 days off. I then emailed, again, the following day saying I need an additional 1-2 days off and that I would return to work as soon as my presence in the hospital was no longer *necessary*. Unfortunately, said family member passed away 2 days ago and the family as a whole has been in *shambles*. I\u2019ve overall taken 4 days off. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is relevant, but this wasn\u2019t a traditional work week. I teach 2 grade-levels and one of them has been off this entire week. Meaning I barely missed any classes at all throughout the whole week (a total of maybe 6 classes). \n\nI was sent an email today saying I\u2019m getting a five day deduction for the four days that I missed.  \n\nI get 3 days off in case of family emergency. But no bereavement leave unless it\u2019s a family member of the first degree (parent, child, or spouse). However, I was living with the family member who recently passed (my grandmother); I have no spouse or children. She *was* my family. \n\nI don\u2019t care about the deduction as much as I\u2019m offended by the lack of compassion from my workplace. Is this something I should argue with human resources upon my return? Can they take the days off as sick days? It feels perfectly reasonable to take 2 days off for a family member being in the ICU and 2 more days off for their passing (burial+funeral). \n\nWhat would you do in this situation?",

        "body": "After I graduated college I continued to maintain a friendship with one of my closest professors/advisors. This professor had a knack for connecting with students who had shown deep interests in our subject area that we were learning and he would often hold casual dinners at his house where we would meet to discuss a variety of different issues after we graduated. These issues would span from world affairs, to pop culture, and of course the current state of education. One of the things that shocked me was when our professor had told us that he had been experiencing an noticeable increase in parents becoming inappropriately involved with their child's college education. For example, he had told us one evening that the amount of helicopter/lawn mower parents at the college level had certainly increased and that he was dealing with angry parents calling his office and/or leaving absurd voicemails ranging from questions about a grade on a paper to even attempting to fight with him over plagiarism investigations. He essentially told us that he felt that all of the poor parent management by administrators and school districts that happens at the middle and high school level was beginning to seep into the college world. I was shocked, but also not surprised by this revelation; well here I sit at my desk several years later and now I have run across an advice piece in our local  newspaper from another professor basically stating that the issues we see at the middle and high school level have penetrated college: [https://www.nj.com/advice/2023/02/miss-manners-i-teach-at-the-college-level-and-im-baffled-by-students-lack-of-engagement.html](https://www.nj.com/advice/2023/02/miss-manners-i-teach-at-the-college-level-and-im-baffled-by-students-lack-of-engagement.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my question is simple, where do we go from here with the state of education? If parents and students in our nation view education as a nuisance that just needs to completed with the least amount of effort put forward, what will our society or nation look like in 30 years? It is truly disheartening to hear that at the college level there is an extreme lack of motivation and that the students could really give a f\\*\\*\\*\\* and that they have a \"give me a grade because my parents pay tuition here\" attitude.",

I have mixed feelings about this, there are pros and cons. I went to a traditional middle school so my experience was different in a lot of ways. \n\nThe biggest difference is the lack of passing time between classes at my current k-8 school. The students literally have to transition in the same way as the kindergarteners (single file line, silently, escorted by a teacher). They also aren\u2019t allowed to have hall passes to go to the bathroom, the teachers take the whole class at once and they all wait in line to take their turn. It seems so developmentally inappropriate, and I feel like they are going to be so unprepared for high school. Does anyone has experience with hallway passing time in a k-8 middle school? What was it like? Is there any happy medium where the middle schoolers can have more autonomy? I know the argument is that they\u2019ll go crazy in the hallways without all the structure, but we have security guards, paras, and teachers who could all monitor the halls and crackdown on kids who are testing the limits. Am I being idealistic? I just see how much the kids absolutely hateeeeee transitions and I don\u2019t blame them!! And I can\u2019t relate at all bc at my traditional middle school we got to chat with friends, get water/use the bathroom, and be responsible for getting ourselves to class on time during our transitions.",

My issue is that such stringency can discourage students to a great extend, if that is all that they get as feedback (which is oftentimes the case, despite the good intentions behind those lower grades). And it's art after all, we are not that many...\n\nIt is somewhat of a complex matter, but I'd like to hear your opinions on this - should I keep pushing the grades a bit higher to provide some encouragement (I'm one of the reasons for grade inflation :) ), or be more stringent (and fair of course)?

I asked if they went to their homeroom teacher and they told me they felt like HR teacher wouldn't do anything about it.

I obviously said yes. Student relays to me that two of the boys in their class (of seven) had been making fun of the three girls in the class, calling them ugly to the point where one of them cried. During the conversation, both of the boys in question tried to cover it up by saying it wasn't a big deal, they were making a big deal of it, and that it was fine because they called one of my students ugly too. \n\nBefore I could really follow-up the conversation, their homeroom teacher came to get them. When the situation was brought up to them, they told the boys they didn't want to hear it and marched them back to the classroom. During the next period, the first student came to me and explained the situation a little bit further. I asked if they had gone to their HR teacher and the response was the class doesn't like bringing things up to their HR teacher because she doesn't listen to them and the girls were afraid nothing could be done. My answer was honesty. I said I would let administration know (because we have a bigger bullying issue that we are trying to squash), and try my best to handle it.\n\nI sent my email explaining the situation, but left out the part about the HR teacher. I don't want them to get into trouble, but I'll also admit that I don't know the whole situation either. I also don't want the other teacher to be mad at me.

Also all the others have been working here for 10+ years \n\nI love my job! This is my second job working with kids but my first school district job, the kids are sweet and the workload isn\u2019t NEARLY as bad as my last job but I always hear crap being said about me. I do my duties, and I usually help out extra but when I don\u2019t I overhear the same ladies saying things like \u201cwow guess she didn\u2019t feel like she needed to help today\u201d which is really discouraging when I\u2019m just trying to help. Also, when I first started the job they were really pushing student connections. The staff that trained me said it was the most important part. So I did! I like to think I built awesome rapport with the students, they come to me a lot (I have even gotten complimented on how quickly I was able to do so by classroom teachers!) The same ladies seem to have a problem with it, they tell me to stop standing around and talking when I am actively helping students with problems AFTER my duties are done. Some of the 5th graders have even come to me saying they overheard those paras talking about me.\n\nIt\u2019s getting really draining and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I am doing something wrong. Is it like this at every school?",

Is this normal? Additionally, all testing is proctored using lockdown browsers and cameras.. I don't understand the intent of testing this way. The grading widely varies from student to student.",

Was it a bluff? \n\nMonths ago, I angered a very prominent family in the district. In fact, the students dad was our mayor. Student was placed in my newspaper class without the pre-req and made editor by a counselor or administrator without my permission. Early on, I called them out on their behavior. Things like mean girl conversations, lateness, no spell-checking, and not helping fellow classmates. I did everything myself. To be honest, the entire thing felt like a setup from the start. Family is next door neighbors to the head principal. Why would a straight A student refuse to work? Principal pulled her and another student with similar behavior out of the class. Claimed \"they didn't want to be in there.\"\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but admin keep tallies of students who drop classes? I presume he could use stuff like this against me?\n\nAt the same time of all of this, \"he claimed\" multiple yearbook students complained about grades. Our computers didn't work for the first 2-3 months of school making kids fall behind. It was like they were adjusted/hacked to go slower than technically possible. I have videos from bootup to start with a time of 28 minutes.... Last year, the principal/tech department refused to upgrade them saying they were fine. Eventually the district level tech guy upgraded them since kids couldn't complete work. For whatever reason, half of the class dropped at semester. I presume because the principal convinced them to do so.   \n\nI was told that I needed to resign or not be renewed. I was called a bad and lazy teacher. I've taught for nearly 20 years. It's complete bullshit. I'm the hardest working teacher I know. I email, call, send letters home to parents, I come early and leave late. I push kids to work. I get top tier results. I explained literally any problem I've ever had dealt with grades. They didn't really have a way to refute or argue that. I explained I'm constantly placed in situations where students and parents expect A's, but it's impossible due to the circumstances surrounding them or admin refusing to back me up. \n\nLast week, I was asked to resign again. Today, I was sent an email by the VP literally saying \"turn in your resignation by tomorrow or be non-renewed.\" I was told in person by the head principal that he \"for sure had the votes.\" \n\nI asked why I hadn't been given an observation in all four years of me being there. Until this year,  I was never told to change anything. Nobody ever watched me teach a lesson. According to my contract, I'm supposed to have a minimum of two per year. I've been given zero. Until this year, I was told \" I like what you're doing, keep it up.\" The principal claimed \"he wasn't my evaluator so he wouldn't know why I hadn't been evaluated.\" This is false. He's listed as co-evaluator in the computer system. He sees everything... In frustration, he said, \"whenever I've been in your room you did a crappy job.\" Does he mean the 50 times he came to talk with me about music or his musical career? Yes, I stopped teaching in those moments to play nice....\n\nI presume observations are required for a non-renewal? I guess nothing would stop them from fraudulently creating some...\n\nOver my four years, I've recorded nearly 300 audio conversations. This may seem weird to some, but due to a prior situation I started recording all meetings. It's allowed in my state. Most of my conversations with admin are sketchy at best. Some very improper and others likely illegal. My admin team does zero discipline and always takes the kids/parents side on everything.  \n\nA couple years ago, the head principal requested that I take pictures for his bands album. I did. Then he asked me for music videos. He wanted to include students, which I considered weird... Also, the video examples he showed me contained some questionable content. \n\nOnce I stopped entertaining the idea of creating them, \"because the idea of filming students felt weird\" he basically wrote me off and started treating me like crap. I presume I wasn't worth anything to him once I stopped helping his music career....\n\nI have a list of emails addresses for every parent in the district. They know this.... Would they really risk me sending all of this stuff out to them? Would they really risk a lawsuit?\n\nThe head principal will not be back next year. He claims to be retiring. It feels off. \n\nSo back to you.... Have you ever been threatened with a non renewal but kept your job? What did you do? Were they just bluffing trying to get your to quit knowing there was no other way?",

I am supervising a pair of conjoined classrooms and after a few minutes, this kid starts handing deflated punch-balloons to every kid in his classroom. Then to the other classroom. He is the hero of the day and the kids are actually using them appropriately! Win-win for me!\n\nAfter recess, I walk down and tell our administrative assistant about this amazing recess we just had. She says... \"Punch balloons? OMG we just had a bag full of those sitting right over here... Which is now gone!\" \n\nThis kid got into a habit of grabbing food from the office (where we almost always have food for any family who needs it) after his noon visit to the nurse. This day, he picked up a random opaque grocery bag. I held it in my hands and thought it was wet clothes. \n\nIt turned out to be punch-balloons, which he then shared with everyone he could find. He was a hero for a day, which he probably needed.  \n\nI was embarrassed that I hadn't questioned a little more, and thought, \"Fail!\" But my mom thought, \"Win!\" For the randomness of it. What do you think? \n\nTl/dr: Annoying 4th grader with rough home life randomly steals a bag of balloons without knowing what it was and shares with two classes, becoming hero for the day.

I've taken on some club mentoring and joined the union board as a department representative after the old representative stepped down and asked me to take over.\n\nAll year, I've been advised on things to do and what not to do from the department, often being reminded that I'm not yet tenured. I took this to mean that I'm on track for a long-term position, but last week, I heard a rumor that the person I stepped in for might be coming back. \n\nThere's currently 5 of us in the department who are nontenured, but we were all rehired last year. If this person I stepped in for returns, one of us would likely be cut. I took this to mean that if it's true, I'm likely losing my dream job. If she returns, one of us will have to be let go. It seems to me that I'd be the easiest and most likely candidate to let go, being that I'm still serving as a long-term sub for the last 2 years. \n\nThe uncertainty is killing me. The thought of having to start over on tenure track in an all new district with a new curriculum is unbearable. I'd rather give up on teaching all together than start over. \n\nI feel like I need to plan for this contingency, but I don't want to make it seem like I am planning on quitting, either.

I had the option between math and history and i chose history because I personally enjoy learning about history. Today was my first day in the class and I was getting a feel for where the students interests lied. Of course I got the typical, \u201cHistory is so pointless\u2026why do we need to know this stuff\u2026it\u2019s all the same\u2026\u201d blah blah blah \n\nSo I challenged them, \u201cOk, then tell me story of America as it\u2019s been taught to you\u201d I got the standard timeline \u201cColumbus..the Colonies..Revolution\u2026Civil War\u2026Civil Right\u2026MLK dies\u2026now\u201d \n\nI replied \u201cNow where does slavery fit into that story?\u201d and it was silence. \n\nNow I didn\u2019t take that moment to start overloading them info, I just told them \u201cYou should look into that.\u201d  I was cognizant of all the controversy about telling kids about certain parts of history but there was a part of me, as a black man teaching black kids, that wanted to just really dig into things. \n\nSo, opening it up to any history teacher, especially ones who are black, about how you all go about teaching the curriculum while knowing more to the story.",

The show is the comedy equivalent of snuggling up in your favorite blanket next to a campfire on a cool summer night.\n\nI find it very relatable with Mr. Pera being a teacher in a somewhat rural community. It is more down to earth than other shows that feature a teacher protagonist. Although Joe Pera is a teacher in the show and many episodes take place in his school, it\u2019s not all about education.\n\nI highly recommend this show if you haven\u2019t seen it. While our jobs can be crazy, watching this show is a great way to wind down and relax from a crazy day teaching. You will find Joe Pera\u2019s outlook on life to be special and positive.

This time, a superintendent left his gun in a Rising Star Elementary School bathroom, only to be found by a third-grader \u2014 who had recently moved from [**Uvalde**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61577777).\n\nAnd as if [**Ted Cruz's beloved armed school officials**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/24/ted-cruz-gun-laws/) weren't incompetent enough, a teacher then allegedly asked another child to check and see if the gun was real. (And no, this is not [**The Onion**](https://www.theonion.com/).)\n\nAfter more than three weeks, however, the now former superintendent, Robby Stuteville, has finally resigned. No word on the teacher's status.\n\nFortunately nobody was injured or killed this time around.\n\nFrom [**WJHL**](https://www.wjhl.com/news/you-cant-mistake-a-life-texas-parents-voice-concern-over-gun-found-in-elementary-bathroom/) on Feb. 18:\n\n&gt;Giovanni Mata, father of a Rising Star student, said his son Leighton was one of the students that discovered the firearm. \u2026  \n\"So the teacher asked another kid, my son\u2026 'Can you go see if it's a real gun?' Why would you send a kid? Why not send someone else,\" Mata expressed.  \nThe incident took place in January, Rising Star Chief of Police Don Braly said his department was not made aware until recently, but an investigation is underway.  \n\"Why, we as parents, had to find out about it through the news. It only makes the school seem like they have something to hide,\" one parent stated.  \nSome felt the issue was being over-emphasized, even addressing their crowd of fellow parents to reprimand.  \n\"How many of your kids have access to guns in your own home? A bunch of you, including mine. I think it's a mistake and I think that you pointing fingers at him for doing something like this is wrong,\" a parent said to the crowd.  \nBut for Mata who recently moved to Rising Star from Uvalde, the incident hits a little too close to home to just be swept under the rug.\n\nAnd from [**Big Country Homepage**](https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/crime/rising-star-superintendent-resigns-after-leaving-firearm-unattended-in-bathroom-for-3rd-grader-to-find/):\n\n&gt;Rising Star's superintendent has resigned days after parents in the district learned he left a firearm unattended in a school bathroom for a 3rd grader to find.  \nDistrict staff confirmed Superintendent Robby Stuteville submitted his resignation from Rising Star ISD effective immediately Monday, February 20.  \nTuesday, February 21, the Rising Star ISD Board of Trustees is holding an emergency meeting to discuss Stuteville's resignation and take appropriate action, including the matter of appointing an acting superintendent.",

        "body": "I was talking to some other teachers at other schools recently, and I watched a few tiktoks that made me wonder about the question above.\n\nIn my school, it's mandatory that we cold call every student at least once during class to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to/following along. Do I do this perfectly? Absolutely not, but admin/superintendent/district people are in/out of my classroom so often this year (new curriculum), that I make sure to do it every day. In my conversations, several teachers lamented how they have a few students who never respond to questions because they're so quiet/don't raise their hand.\n\nHand raising doesn't even exist in my school (unless they're working on their own and are letting me know they need help). I've even had several students with mutism who weren't ignored by this. I had them write their answers on paper and show me/checked with them one-on-one.\n\nIs this practice not normal?",

If she fails or doesn't do well on a test, she gets her phone taken off her, grounded, etc. This also goes for tutoring. I like to set students periodical tests to test their progress, but her OBVIOUS fear has started to seep into me. I feel so sad for her that she's trying her best and still not meeting her mum's expectations. I've never lied to her mum about her test scores or strengths/weaknesses, but every week I feel the temptation to lessen her punishments in some way or another. I am humbly asking for help from the teachers here! I don't want to interfere in her family life. But she's not a slacker, and nowadays a kid having their phone (&amp; contact with their friends) taken away for the whole of half term is really a very harsh punishment.",

I've been in one particular field for about 18 years, and (a) I've topped-out, (b) I'm burnt-out (to a cinder, honestly), and (c) the thought of doing this for the next 25 years makes my stomach hurt.\n\nSo, here I am. Maybe I'll become a teacher!\n\nI've lurked this sub for a while and I've read the horror stories with interest. I believe I would be able to effectively noodle through the most-common aggravations with the admins, the parents, and the disrespectful students, and that those issues are distinct-enough from my issues with my current job that it wouldn't be a frying-pan-into-the-fire job transition. I believe that some of my current day-to-day skills (sales/marketing, customer management) could help me work a classroom. I like all the sentimental stuff about changing young lives, and I honestly think I'd be good at it (but then, most people probably do). \n\nBut, I'm 40. Am I being weird? In your experience, how do folks my age do, as entry-level teachers? Any stories you can share? What am I missing?\n\nRelated question! Obviously, I'd want to do a good job, and to be part of a program to develop the skills that can be developed. I'd want a support network. So, Teach for America seems... sensible. I've heard different things about how established educators feel about T4A itself, as well as the teachers from its program. Any thoughts would be very much appreciated.",

It also shows that students can manage their emotions and cope with being bored.  They should be able to focus on tasks they find completely uninteresting.",

        "body": "Reading news, comments, etc, the teaching conditions in the US seem pretty bad overall. However, I often wonder how worse it can be compared to what we have here. So here it goes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm a teacher somewhere else in the world, so I got no idea how it really works in the US... but some of my coworkers spent years working over there, and they always praise how well-paid they were and how easy it was in pulbic schools, since lessons are pre-planned and students never surpass the 30 per classroom (we normally get 35+ here). \n\nThey also had a salary of about 2,5k-5k month (US dollars), which is a *really* good salary here, for any carreer. For reference, most teachers make 800 a month.\n\nSo that makes me wonder:\n\n1. Is it that we have *that* bad of a standard here? Or is it that US standards have fallen over the last 15 years, since they were working over there?\n2. Does it depend on the US state, maybe? Better conditions depending on where in the US? They were working in Indiana.\n3. Is a salary of 5k a month bad in the US? If so, how expensive stuff can be over there? For reference, here rent is about 600 for a 1-bedroom apartment in an ok location (you can guess, most teachers cannot live on their own *and* pay rent).\n\nSorry for the dumb questions. I prefer to get first-hand experiences not only from my coworkers, but from people actually living in the US right now. Thanks!",

I have an observation soon, and it is an important one (it goes on your record, affects your future employment etc.).

But they are expected to pass their high school exams [somehow], so I teach for that (not optional) and then I\u2019m blamed for their low results. \n\n\nThat was an intro, a sad one... \nWhat is the best way to demonstrate effective learning? Differentiation? That I presented and measured objectives? \nMy ideas are: either a listening or a reading lesson where I provide some worksheets with support to the weaker students. But then how do we check the answers together if they are doing different tasks? And what is the best way to pass around those materials? \nMy main issue is that when I ask questions nobody answers. They never use my hints or materials I provide. I scaffold every step, I do games and have visuals but they never use them. So once I\u2019m done with my \u201cteaching\u201d stage I\u2019m worried there will be silence and confusion during the \u201cpractice\u201d stage.

        "body": "Hey all, I'm graduating soon and going into teaching history. I know the adage \"what do you want to coach.\" I really have no interest in coaching. Staying late 2 hours every single day for only about $150 extra at a rate of what is probably $5 an hour is not appealing at all. However, I am willing to grit my teeth and coach for my first year if it helps me get into a good school. In my county, you are tenured after three years, so you stay at the same school for that span until you can transfer. What I'm curious about is if I'm volun-told to coach a sport when hired, do I have to stay as a coach for that three-year span, as well, or can I coach my first year to get my foot in the door and then stop coaching the year following? I'm wanting to do my Master's Degree in either the Spring semester of my first year or the Summer after my first year, and there is no way I'd be able to work nearly 50-60 hours a week and complete my Master's degree at the same time. \n\nAlso, I have been a substitute teacher in my county for two years now, and will have three years experience as a sub when I graduate. Would that hold any sway in hiring me potentially only as a teacher and not a coach?",

        "body": " I'm sure that by now, most teachers have come across essays written by ChatGPT and articles about how it might be a threat to the education of students. However, it doesn't have to be that way. As the educational system changed when the internet became widely popular, a similar change might happen now. While some teachers might feel skeptical about AI tools, I believe that they have the potential to improve the way we teach and learn.\n\nHere, I want to focus on some original ways in which you can use ChatGPT to improve your teaching and the student experience.\n\nOne fascinating way I found to integrate ChatGPT into teaching is by making it write essays on class topics and having the students analyze and provide feedback. This method requires the students to mark up the text and point out where ChatGPT has made mistakes. It is not only valuable for students in terms of critical thinking skills but also for teachers as they can see where their own knowledge of the subject might need improvement. This also think that this approach enhances the students' analytical skills and exposes them to the potential of AI.\n\nThrough the process of marking up the text and pointing out mistakes, students are learning how to adapt to AI and use it to their advantage. These are the essential skills that they will undoubtedly need in the workplace of the future. This approach encourages the development of technological literacy, making students comfortable with AI and its role in the future of work. Overall, this innovative teaching technique using ChatGPT has the potential to improve the students' academic performance and their future career prospects.\n\nLet's take a look at how this method can be applied in law and history classes.\n\n**Law Classes**\n\nIn law classes, ChatGPT can be used to generate hypothetical cases, providing students with a unique opportunity to analyze and evaluate various legal arguments. Students can mark up the text and point out any mistakes or biases that ChatGPT may have made in its legal analysis. By analyzing these cases and providing feedback, students can develop critical thinking skills and improve their understanding of complex legal concepts. This approach helps students to learn how to work with AI in a legal context, promoting their technological literacy and preparing them for the future of work in law.\n\n**History Classes**\n\nIn history classes, ChatGPT can be used to write essays on historical events and figures, providing students with a new and exciting perspective on their studies. By marking up the text and pointing out any mistakes, students can develop their analytical skills and evaluate the accuracy of the AI-generated content. This approach can also help students gain a deeper understanding of historical events and their significance. Teachers can use this feedback to identify where students may be struggling with the subject matter and tailor their teaching methods to improve their understanding. This approach helps students to learn how to work with AI in a historical context, promoting their technological literacy and preparing them for the future of work in history-related fields.\n\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg.

        "body": "Beware. This is going to be part vent, part rant, and all-around confusion.\n\nI just finished a tutoring session with a grade (year) 6 student. He is still struggling with his multiplication facts. It was our first session, so I wanted to see the extent of his lack of skills. He claimed he knew his 1,2,5,10,11, and part of his 3s. So, we started with 3-digit by 1-digit multiplication. It was rough. He first looked at the problem like he was totally lost, but when I broke it down into individual problems, he did better. So instead of having him solve 724\\*4. we did 4\\*4, then 4\\*2+1, etc. Then we moved to the multiplication square to see how much he knew. This he completed with relative ease, until we got to 6,7,8,9, 12. That's when I saw that he didn't know the communicative property and was trying to memorize the entire square. His scared look also made more sense when I asked him to solve 12\\*2. He was trying to do it all in his head, instead of working it out on paper. \n\nA lot of my students have the same problem (15 so far in years 4-6). If they can't do it in their head, then they don't try or just guess. I tell them to do it on paper and they look at me like I just grew a horn or turned purple.\n\nI need someone to explain this to me. Why are teachers making their students do huge multiplication problems in their heads instead of on paper? And why are they not showing students that you can flip the numbers around to get the same answer? My poor student today acted like this was some amazing brand-new information. He genuinely did not know that 2\\*12=12\\*2=24.\n\nI am studying to become a teacher and I understand the memorization of multiplication facts, but only up to a certain point. I would never expect my students to have 724\\*4 memorized. That is just bananas. I would also never force them to do it in their heads either. That is why pencils and erasers were invented! Especially not at year 6. When they get older and have had a few more years with larger numbers, then yes, let them do it in their heads, but at 5th grade, give the kid some paper.\n\nI would also show them that they can use their previous work or problems to help them solve future ones. You have no idea how many eyes light up when I tell my students that have already solved the sample problem and can look back at their previous work for guidance. My poor student today had finally gotten 4\\*4=16 and 7\\*4=28, but when it came back around as 4\\*7, mind was stuck until I said look up here at this problem. But that is another rant/vent.",

(My mental health was also a factor; was in severe burnout and depression) I was hoping to find a position mid-year to get my foot in the door somewhere but nothing worked out. So here we are. Hoping I can get a regular teaching position for the 23-24 school year.\n\nDespite that, I\u2019m glad I got the opportunity to long term sub and considering my current health needs it\u2019s probably a better situation than what I was hoping for. I\u2019m just really nervous and, honestly, not sure why. I guess where it\u2019s new and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m walking into. I am clinically diagnosed with major anxiety/minor depression so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s related to that as well.\n\nI visit the teacher and her class this week and I\u2019m excited but equally scared. Mostly of behaviors (my last district was a bit of a nightmare). Also I\u2019m a bit nervous teaching pregnant (this is my first) but I know plenty have done it. Not sure why I\u2019m sharing, I guess just to vent and get out this nervous feeling.\n\nI know everything will work out and if it is overwhelming at least I know it\u2019s temporary.

Part way through my senior year I changed in my mind what I wanted to do to as a job, teaching, so I just finished my 2 degrees since I was basically done. A few weeks after graduation my church pastor from college posted about an opportunity in Mexico City. A church had created an English based elementary school and was still looking for a teacher or two. So fast forward to now I have been teaching 4th grade since August and I have enjoyed it so much.\n\nWith all that being said, I am planning on staying another year (maybe 2) and starting online classes in the evenings to work towards a teaching degree so I could eventually teach in the states. So for those who already graduated college with a non-teaching degree and are teachers now, I am looking for tips on what you did, suggestions, or even what online schools you did and your thoughts.\n\nI currently have 2 options I'm looking at: One being to teach elementary aged children. The second being to teach high school Spanish, so your thoughts or experience on either would be appreciated.\n\nSome info that might be helpful: I am from Iowa and would probably want to stay there for teaching. I would love to teach at a Spanish-English bilingual school if that adds any extra steps.",

I had my boyfriend help me with studying the math parts and it didn't do a lick of good. None of the math questions on the test were even remotely the same as the practice test or as the first test. In the first test they were the same kind of problems just with different numbers and different questions but this time they were completely different kinds of math. I know for sure I feel this test by more than just six points and it just really sucks because I really did practice and study for this test.

The programs we offer are completely free to public schools through government grants, are on various science subjects, essentially an employee comes into a classroom, brings all the equipment needed for science experiments and does a roughly 2 hour workshop consisting of a powerpoint then several group science experiments. I have been directly emailing teachers to market these workshops, but haven't gotten very many responses. We have gotten great feedback on the few programs in my area that I have done so far, and the workshops are very popular in regions we have serviced for longer. My question to everyone is what is the best way to reach out to teachers/schools with fully subsidized programs? These are programs aimed towards elementary school students (grades 3/4 to 7) in Canada if that is helpful.",

I was told I would simply go into preschool classrooms all day and maintain the classrooms as teachers took their prep period. \n\nNo planning, just maintaining. I agreed and was eager to begin. \n\nLong story short, my first day was horrible. I arrived and was told I would be in the library. I explained my position and that I was told I\u2019d be going into the classrooms (even toured the school prior with the man who hired me). She explained that I am the new library special teacher. This is the teacher relief in question. To save all the details, the day was HORRIBLE. I feel so out of place, confused, anxious, and lost. I can tell I will hate this. I want to be in the classroom, not in charge of a library where I now must plan daily and maintain the space. I have no resources, or guidelines or help. I was thrown to the wolves. A student teacher told me the two people prior to me quit, one walking out on the job.\n\nIt is a good district, that I hoped to apply for a full time job come the fall (not this specific school, but the district). \n\nI need advice\u2026 Can I quit? Should I quit? How soon is it okay to quit? Am I completely burning bridges? I planned to voice my concerns after this week then quit shortly after if no resolution/help comes from reaching out. I was going to explain I thought this was a hands on, in the classroom job. I don\u2019t feel qualified for what I am doing. I am an anxious, sad mess.",

School 1 is wonderful - thoughtful students from parents who care about their education, great coworkers, a supportive principal who lurks the hallways and is always there for her staff members. School 2, however... is hell. \n\nTwo incidents have pushed me over the edge. One occurred during a lunch duty. A 2nd grader said that he wanted to kill himself. He started scratching at his arms so he could \"find his vein to end his life.\" He used a plastic fork to imitate the act of cutting. I rushed to get our principal, who happened to be in the lunchroom for once. When I interrupted a conversation, she smirked and said, \"Well, you act like this doesn't happen every day.\" Coworkers from the middle school told me that she also called our 7th grade honors math class \"stupid\" for not solving a riddle that she had posted on the board for them when the teacher was out. \n\nI ate my lunch in the faculty room. Fellow teachers were talking about one family (two girls and a boy). One said loudly for the rest of us to hear that she thought the middle daughter was gonna \"wind up pregnant in 10 years\" and they \"better pin all of their hopes on the youngest girl\" because the boy isn't going anywhere. \n\nI don't know... It's been two weeks and I can't stop thinking about the incidents. I'd report them to my principal, but they're also a huge chunk of the problem. I'm scared to get other teachers in trouble.  For the most part, these are all good kids from troubled backgrounds. They're chaotic, but they're just reacting to the stimuli around them. \n\nI'm already mentally unwell, and I've just been in despair all year. Between the complete disrgard for my subject, constant destruction of my room, and unprofessional comments from staff members, I feel numb. Nothing has improved over the past trimester. My therapist has encouraged me to stay the rest of the year, but I know that I need to get out at the year's end. \n\nI could use some advice and encouragement on how I can maintain my sanity until June.",

I'm the only teacher at the school who teaches the two subjects I have, so I only have the teacher edition textbooks to help make lesson plans. I try using TPT and Google, but I feel like I'm treading water and frustrating my students with the lack of clear unit learning goals. Add on top of this that I dont really understand how to create NGSS alligned units and also trying to care for my young infant, and it all feels like chaos.\n\nI know I'm just surviving day to day, and I don't know how to fix this. I know I want to keep this job, but I feel like such a failure right now.",

        "body": "Good afternoon everyone! \n\nI am in my first year post-college graduation with a degree I do not plan on using (psychology, minor in Spanish), little excitement about any particular career out there (corporate life looks so soul sucking), and find myself more and more just missing the educational environment. Maybe that\u2019s because that\u2019s what I\u2019m most familiar with, maybe I peaked in high school, who knows. \nFor about the last 6 months, I\u2019ve just been constantly job hunting and working a SUCKY healthcare job as a CNA on a cardiac floor of a hospital, and nothing\u2019s clicked so far. No job oit there looks very appealing\u2014there\u2019s no spark. Then this last week, I went to see my old friend\u2019s brother at our state wrestling tournament. And boom. A spark. I missed the environment, the energy, etc of seeing high schoolers with their whole life still ahead of them. And I started wondering\u2026do I go into teaching and coaching? Is that the answer? \n\nYou guys and gals are all teachers, and I see a lot of negativity on here\u2026a lot of reasons to NOT go into teaching. I\u2019m here to ask the opposite question: what keeps you all going? How do you know if it\u2019s the right field for you? And what advice would you give someone like me who is interested but sees all these cons going into it?\n\nThanks all!",

I teach all three grades and only have math textbooks for 7th grade.   I have 1 book each for my 6th and 8th grade.  I have been asking for help all year with resources and the only thing I've been given is use prodigy.  My students hate prodigy.   I have started using 99math and the kids love it but it's designed as warmups (5 minutes in length).  I tested positive for covid on Saturday so I'm out the whole week.  I was working on my Google classroom when an email came in from my principal. It had a list of websites (1 for each content areas) for the kids to practice on.  The superintendent decided that these websites are better than prodigy.   The principal wants us to have all of our students signed up by tomorrow morning. The math recommendation was Carnegie learning for middle school, nothing was given for science.  We have 11 weeks left in school.",

        "body": "It looks like there is a lot of venting about student teaching on here, so I hope you'll tolerate one more.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking the requirements for student teaching are fucking ridiculous?\n\nI am currently in my student teaching semester, so effectively a full-time job with no pay.\n\nMy university also has required classes from 5-7:30 pm on Mondays and Thursdays, which don't actually teach anything, instead just requiring a bunch of annoying \"reflections\" about how everything is going. There is absolutely no value to them beyond soaking up yet another five hours of my week, plus whatever it takes to write the stupid reflection.\n\nAnd of course, my landlord doesn't accept hopes and dreams for rent, so I have to fit in a job where I can, while also listening to the director of the program lecture me on how they recommend not working this semester, because student teachers are expected to just not eat for four months I guess.\n\nWhat really snapped my twig was at the beginning of the semester the district I'm student teaching in offered to pay me for it, which would have alleviated about 90% of my problems, but my university wouldn't allow it and my asking prompted the program director to stop by a Monday night class to reassure us that they don't allow us to be paid for our own good. Apparently paying student teachers is \"exploitive,\" but working for free all semester is just fine and dandy.\n\nWhat the hell did you guys do to survive? I'm currently testing the patience of my electric company to see if I can make it to payday while still having lights.",

My admin told me I could take Friday as a mental health day, but I decided since it was the last day before a week break it would be better to go in.\n\nI found out more about who was involved, they are genuinely (mostly) regretful and embarrassed.  Two of the boys came up to me before school and told me they had confessed to their parents, and apologized for the position they put me in.\n\nAt lunch all of the parents except one came in unannounced.  To say I was nervous to meet with them would be an understatement.  My EA and I met with them and explained what had happened.  I apologized for letting them down.  At which point, they said \"Teachermom, we don't hold you responsible for what happened.  You made a human mistake, one any one can make.  We are here because we are worried about you.  Our boys are worried about you.  EA told them you could be in a lot of trouble because of what they did, and we are here to find out how we can help you.\"\n\nThis right here is why I love my job so much.  Planning for 35 kids over 10 grades is a lot of work.  But I get to teach them for everyone of those grades if I choose to.   The parents and kids become like family, you go to weddings and funerals, I've joined them for canning days in the summer.  Those community links are just not the same in other schools.",

I\u2019m trying to sort through whether I try another school or just leave the field altogether. I\u2019ve made a list of the reasons I am leaving my current school, and I want to know if other schools are like this.\n\n\t1.\tNo consequences for student misbehavior within the school outside of extreme cases. The only consequences for being disruptive or disengaged in my class is an endless stream of calls home, which I rarely feel up to doing outside of contract hours for widespread issues like phone use or work refusal. (This is a part of a broader struggle with work/life balance).\n\t2.\tThe work is lonely - I feel very isolated from my students and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a part of a office/workplace community in a way I did in my last career with the little contact I have with other teachers. \n\t3.\tMy students are very challenging. Some students are traditionally engaged and ready to learn, but I find most are either zombie-like, phone addicted, zoned out or are very child-like in their lack of self-regulation with their peers. It seems that most of my students regard my attempts to refocus them as a rude intrusion on their time. I think the school culture (again, minimal consequences) reinforces a lot of negative behaviors among students. I\u2019m fairness to them, I understand that they face challenges outside of school that they bring in, but I also don\u2019t think the school expects enough of them. \n\t4.\tThe administration is very hands off about most things. I can\u2019t even get anyone into my most difficult classes to show that students are on their radar. The most I seem to get from anyone are some small instructional changes and the implication that my students would behave if I were a better teacher (which could be true, but it doesn\u2019t help me very much in the moment). Each classroom is treated as a silo, where every issue is isolated and a problem for me to solve with minimal help from the administrators. \n\nAre other schools like this? If so, I might try a career change after the end of the school year. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",

I got into a big argument defending my coworkers and myself from being overworked as well as caddiness from certain teachers and the VP. The VP pulled me in and gas lit me saying that everything is my fault for riling up all the other staff and then said that we are all replaceable. Oh I'm replaceable during an education shortage? After that I decided to quit and be a substitute teacher in a few districts on an emergency cert, including the one I left. Ever since I left it has been a shit show for them as 3 other people left after me and the couple people they got to replace arent even showing up to work. Best part is, I get to show up almost everyday to sub and make more money while being good at what I do and happy.",

        "body": "So today is parent teacher conferences, and I had a student and parent come to me to discuss his progress in my \"catch-up\" math class.  Conversation turned towards his regular math class, and the parent expressed the age-old problem that many parents have:\n\n\"I don't know how to help my child with math.\"  This parent expressed that \"all the graphing stuff\" (slope, intercept, etc.) was giving both of them anxiety and she couldn't really help him.  They asked me for some ideas.\n\nFirst, I suggested she use Desmos Graphing calculator so she could see an answer to help him check his work, but I expressed my dismay that it can't explain why and how to graph that equation.\n\nThen I remembered ChatGPT.  The parent had heard about it on Reddit, but had never checked it out for themself, so I showed it to them and asked it to explain how to graph y = x + 7.  ChatGPT provided a detailed, accurate, step-by-step guide on how to graph that specific equation.  Could this be the solution to a major problem that parents and students face?  For those parents who truly want to help their children (and not do it for them), could this be the way?\n\nWhat do y'all think?",

BE TASK SPECIFIC\nOutline exactly what tasks the kids are doing, not just what they need to click on Tell us whether it's a quiz or bunch of questions or whatever and list what is to be done. This lets us more easily hold students to account about what they need to do, in what order and to easily pinpoint progress by the class to report you back to with!\nWithout this, we're none the wiser and relegated to a pair of eyeballs over the age of 18 and actually know *less* about expectations than what the students are doing themselves\n\n2. KNOW YOUR VENUE\nPlease tell us what class you're in and double check this. I often get told the completely wrong classroom and end up coming late and making myself look like a right muppet.\n\n3. NO \"ESCAPE ROOM\" INSTRUCTIONS\nIf some more sophisticated equipment is needed for a lesson, make the instructions as simple as possible or get a regular to make it easier for us to access. We're often hopping from class to class with little turnaround time and if we're entering a classroom for a first time with 2 minutes before the lesson begins and got an \"escape room\"-ish task to turn on a projector, either simplify it through regular staff or ditch it entirely.\n\n4. PROBLEM STUDENTS\nBriefly and discreetly let us know which students can be bother and if any have special ed requirements so we can consistently treat them with understanding and in an appropriate manner. A simple pro forma for your classes that can be copied and pasted into lesson plans will save you the bother sooner rather than later.\n\nThe lessons where I have issues are the ones which are 5 lines of vague instructions. They assume the students are on the EXACT same wavelength about what they have set for them and everything is in place with good behaviour with focused students to match otherwise it makes our jobs 10 times harder.\n\nPlease, help us subs to help you!!!",

        "body": "This I a long story. I have been teaching Pre-K for two years now in a traditional setting.  Previously, I was a Montessori assistant for 10 years in both public and private schools.  I decided to go get my masters and teacher certification once my kids all left home.\nHere is the issue.  I  began working in a traditional elementary school that has a decent reputation.  However, the principal had just started there the previous year and is not well liked.  The school has been hemorrhaging employees since she arrived.  I was quite smitten with her at first, but now I have had quite enough of her invalidating words and behaviors, and most especially, the eye rolling.  The AP also has left due to her unhappiness, so we have a brand new AP who has been a high-school AP only.\nMy class has four students who have not settled in at all.   It started with one, who would throw tantrums from hell when he was not the first to be called on, answered uncorrected, didn't get to sit where he wanted,  stand in line where he wanted, etc.  He even takes food from other children's plates during lunch and breakfast.  Theae tantrums include hitting me and any other adult, ripping things off the wlls, screaming, throwing chairs, tablea, dumping supplies in the floor, and more. Of course, our district uses conscious discipline, which means this child never has consequences. The other children saw over the course of this year, that this child is pretty much rewarded for this behavior by getting taken on walks, given extra privileges like calling his mom during the school day, and adults tiptoeing around ro avoid starting a row.  \nCut to three weeks ago.  The instructional assistant in the room couldn't take it anymore.  She was sick of bein talked down to by admin ( been doing this 24 years and well qualified) and having to cater to bad behavior,  so she quit.  Since then, the three kids who  all have anger issues and poor boundaries at home have gone hog wild.  They are all three imitating the behavior of the one origional outlier.   It's really bad.  I feel horrible for the rest of the class because I cannot teach properly in this room, as I am always putting out fires and stopping violence, and now they have all 4 started opening doors and running.  In all my years, I have never seen anything like this.  Admin tells me they do not mind coming and assisting, yet many times when I call them, they come in making sarcastic comments.   \nI absolutely know I am not perfect,  and I'm sure there are ways I can improve.  That being said, we are not even allowed to put these children in time out.  I have never seen anything like this, though.  But other pre-k teachers tell me they have.  \nDo 8 need to look elsewhere, or is this just what it's like out here now?",

        "body": "Hi! First year middle school ELA teacher here, the school I work at is very understaffed and administration keeps admonishing us for \u201cnot keeping track of our students.\u201d \n\nThere are 86 kids in the 7th grade and only 3 teachers. We had a fire drill the other day and kids were hiding and then a fight broke out when we were outside. \n\nAdministration said that we need to be accountable for all kids whereabouts all the time but they come and go as they please. I constantly see kids wandering the hallways and have to escort them back to class which takes up my planning and lunch. I have instituted a group bathroom time for each class to avoid issuing passes. I have made expectations clear. I have written referrals but honestly who has the time to fill out 10 plus referrals each day and place the required parent phone call\nTo notify them? \n\nWhat has worked for you to hold kids accountable and ensure their safety?\n\n\nThe kids are also incredibly disrespectful, the other day one of them told me I was an \u201cugly, fat bitch\u201d in front of a classroom of other children. How do you handle this level of disrespect when referrals, parent phone calls, and restorative conversations have done nothing? I feel like I need a degree in behavior management to handle these some of these children.\n\nIn addition, they are all almost 2 grade  levels behind where they should be which makes teaching the standards incredibly challenging. Whenever admin walks in to shadow me I feel like I\u2019m going to have an anxiety attack and anytime that the kids are on task and having a good day I am the only adult in the room.\n\n\nI began my job at the   charter school I work at in the middle of the year. I received no training at all and I don\u2019t have a degree in education. I was literally handed a laptop and the pacing guide and thrown in the deep end. I was not even trained on technology we use or on how to input grades.\n\nLesson planning, modeling, guided instruction, independent practice, behavior management, differentiated instruction- all of this is new to me and I\u2019m incredibly stressed replaying situations in my head and terrified that I did not handle things correctly. Please help!",

        "body": "This has been an ongoing problem for us ever since parents had to share some of the responsibility during the remote learning phase of COVID, when they suddenly no longer wanted to be a part of the process.\n\nOn Friday, I sent a Talking Points message to every parent on my roster - about 120 families. It stated that my grades on  the online gradebook (Home Access) has been updated and I requested that they review them with their child. I then offered to make a personal phone call, if desired. to discuss their child\u2019s grades and progress. I asked that they reply with the number that would be best to use and their preference for a day and time for contacting them, for their convenience (definitely not mine).\n\nWhile the majority of my students are failing miserably due to just not turning in ANY work, only FOUR parents replied. And only two of those requested a phone call. Both of those were first-generation immigrant parents, non-English speakers, whom I have found to be the most supportive parents when compared to the majority of parents who have lived in this community all of their lives.\n\nHave we really reached the point where we care more than the parents? I\u2019m in my 24th year and my failure rates have never been this high. - not even close. I have never had so many students just not bother to do ANY work. And I have certainly never had this poor of a response from parents when it came to their child\u2019s grades. I know of multiple parents who blocked the school\u2019s number so they CAN\u2019T be reached. \n\nI know it\u2019s been joked about in the past, but have we really become just babysitters?

Teachers, who are in a separate union, are being required to report to school for remote learning. Our union president has said that if we do not report to work, we will be immediately terminated. The attorney for our union has offered to represent us if we are terminated, but said that we would lose in court. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into the suggestions that some of you gave, but they were not successful.  Apparently, we are not allowed to sympathy strike due to our contract. The working conditions in the contract call for adequate heating, and that\u2019s it. Apparently, having no one around to oversee the boiler room isn\u2019t a problem. There\u2019s also no Covid mandates that were found to keep us from coming in. \n\nI honestly think that our union president has been dropping the ball on this.  We are so left out of the communication that it\u2019s infuriating. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted. In 18 years of teaching, I\u2019ve never been put into a situation like this.  The support staff wants raises of 6%, 5%, and 5% for their new contract, and they want the 6% to be applied retroactively to the beginning of this school year. The superintendent just gave himself a 16% raise last year.",

I am trying to go back to school after a long break and it is causing me a lot of stress.I have fallen so behind in my school work and it causes me to have suicidal thoughts. I have been trying to get a masters degree for eight years. And because I don't have any motivation it has been harder. My lack of motivation might be due to my depression. I also have a rough time balancing school with work. I am also worried about my mother. She seems to be developing knee problems. She works as a nurse at night and I am worried something bad might happen to her since she is always entering other people's homes. I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels. I am making a plan to kill myself if my family doesn\u2019t give me more time to finish my masters degree after I pass my mtels. Mtels are exams people have to take to become teachers.I might as well be dead anyways because I won\u2019t be able to afford living on my own. And I won\u2019t be able to pass my student teaching if I don\u2019t have extra time to study all my class notes.. I am dreading telling her that I have even more work to do. I have to go back and study the class notes from all of my classes that I have taken during graduate school, Which is about 8 classes. Since I have been out of school for so long I need to refresh my memory.. I'm worried that my mom might kick me out when she finds out that it is going to take me longer to graduate. I don't blame her. I've been in school for eight years! She is getting tired of me. I should have studied harder. And my credit card debt is stressing me out. And my sister is getting mad at me because of all the reasons my mother is. She's tired of me living off of my mom and not talking responsibility for my life. She\u2019s even suggesting that I cut my hours at work to study for my mtels, which is not something I can afford to do since I have so many bills. I just wanted to talk about why I am depressed. I\u2019m tired of being alive. It feels like there is nothing to look forward too. I will be making plans to kill myself within a year if things don\u2019t get better",

        "body": "Hi! My union is offering a program where you can get your Masters in Education online from Spalding University for less than 10k. I have been thinking about grad school for a while so thought it was a great opportunity and am working on my application. However, I am a little confused on their state agreements. \n\nI am currently living and teaching in Hawaii but am originally from California. Spalding has a state agreement with Hawaii so I can complete an online degree with them. Spading does not have a state agreement with California, so if I was living in California I could not complete the degree program. Does this mean the completed degree \"won't count\" if I were to want to teach in California? Or just to attend? I can't find information on if they accept the completed degree. I am from CA so want to keep the option open to teach there if need be! Any advice appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the link saying the SARA works for HI but not CA: [https://spalding.edu/licensing-disclosures/](https://spalding.edu/licensing-disclosures/)",

        "body": "Hey y'all. I'm a third year first grade teacher in a bit of a strange situation, and could use some advice. This is my first year at an in-person public school, and things have been chaotic as all hell. Previously I worked at a private school and then a virtual school, so working in person is a completely different ball game. Last year I was pink slipped due to lack of enrollment, which I completely expected due to me being on a temporary contract anyways. But this year I was brought up to a probationary contract, and I think I assumed this meant a little more job security along with the bonus in pay scaling. This however, is not necessarily the center of the story.\nI wont lie, I haven't been the best teacher this year. I was really struggling with one student in particular - he had some serious emotional management issues, and quite literally every day had some sort of emotional break down. He would cry and scream, push chairs and desks, and it eventually escalated to him making enormous messes out of my classroom multiple times. Fortunately no one was hurt, but it wasn't a safe environment for anyone, and I 100% neglected the other students learning in order to try and keep him calm, which never worked anyways. I did my best to keep my principal and the counselor informed, and we worked together as best we can to come up with ways to help him keep his cool and support him. Unfortunately, things escalated and I ended up needing to make a CPS report. Not long after that, my student had the worst day he's ever had, destroyed my classroom twice, and the Principal made the decision to send him home for the day. Two days later, he was unenrolled from the school, and the principal said mom had pulled him out. I have been working on my classroom management since then, and I think things have been improving bit by bit. \nHowever, this past Thursday my principal called me into her office to let me know that I would not be returning next year. Initially I had figured it was because she had mentioned there might need to be some restructuring of teachers because of budgets or things like that, which I would understand. However, when I asked why, my principal said that there was some legal reasons why she couldn't tell me, and that \"I had to meet with HR first.\"\nHere's where I could use advice - how badly did I fuck up? What should I do to either protect myself or learn from the experience? I'm trying to give my principal the benefit of the doubt, but I'm also just incredibly confused as to why I have to go through HR to find out why I'm not coming back. I know I should contact my union rep just in case, but what else should I do/prepare for?",

The former coworker takes screenshots of their conversations and posts them to her Snapchat story, laughing about it.\n\n\nI'm not sure if the other 2 participants know that their private conversations are being shared, but there's information in that chat being said about people that is really unkind.\n\nA separate coworker was outed as bisexual (name wasn't mentioned, but a rude Nickname was used).\n\n\nNormally, I would just try to let this slide, but this past weekend, I felt as if some of the messages/insults were targeted towards me.\n\nThe most ironic part is that one of the coworkers who is doing the bullying always posts on Facebook calling people out for being \"fake\".\n\n\nI cannot get this out of my head. I could be totally off base in thinking that the messages were about me, and I feel that if I ask, they won't tell me the truth anyway.\n\n\nI don't know what to do, honestly. It's not okay that one person is bragging about bullying people.\n\nWhat they say in a private group chat is their own business. They can have their opinions about people all they want. \n\nColoring out the names of the people in the chat does not make it any less obvious who the people are. \n\n\nAdvice is appreciated.",

I don\u2019t want to be that type of teacher, and it\u2019s generally very difficult for me to get angry, but I literally feel my anger build up, heart pumps fast, I get hot flashes and I start yelling.\n\nI haven\u2019t insulted anyone, I just loudly remind the kids that they\u2019re at school and that they\u2019ll do as I say. I\u2019ve threatened to speak to their parent/teacher. One kid was particularly bad in the first two lessons, but I took some time to speak to him 1:1 and he\u2019s doing so much better now. I can\u2019t spend 1:1 with each kid, though. So how do I gain their respect as a group?\n\nI feel immense guilt for yelling at them, I don\u2019t want them to be scared of me, I want to be respected and liked as a teacher. How to let go of this guilt and learn to manage the class better? The kids are young and it\u2019s hard for them to focus, but they get so distracted that we can\u2019t even go through any material. \n\nAny and all advice is welcome.",

So, I am tutoring a student that is taking one of my courses (honors Global 9) but at another school with a teacher that is quite a strict grader, uses a slightly different curriculum, and gives a lot of his instructions/guidelines in-class, making them inaccessible to me. My student has gotten a few mediocre grades (80-89 range) for reasons that, in some cases, are not stated within his rubrics or seem out of step with how I would assess the work. \n\nI'm of the mindset that this is fine, as it's more valuable of a learning experience for this student to make mistakes and learn from them than me just write their essays for them or do the worksheets myself, but I'm curious how other folks approach situations like this. To be fair, I am someone that puts very little stock in numerical grading in terms of overall holistic student assessment practices so I may seem a bit more lax than many when these topics come up.   \n\n\nSide note: I usually only tutor within my school which allows me to mitigate these types of problems as I can just speak with the teachers themselves, but this is a relative so it was difficult to decline when they asked for some assistance. As I rarely tutor, I am curious what other folks' experience with situations like this (that, I imagine, are somewhat common) might be and how you've addressed it with the student and their family.",

I am a high school math teacher at a credit recovery school and I get the school I teach has students from the roughest part of the town but do they still not need bare minimum like simple addition and subtraction . The student I teach, 90% of them have math skills that of a 5th grader . Of course they fail my class and are moved into credit recovery where they can cheat and easily pass the class. If that\u2019s so easy why am I even there ? Do I spend all my weekend planning to come up with lessons that are more \u201cengaging\u201d and relatable when all they do complain when they have to solve ONE problem on their own and can\u2019t even successfully do so . Homework ? What is that ? Nobody knows and nobody cares . \n\nIf I give them class quiz they laugh in my face because they give up even before reading the instructions. The other day on their they were just circling problem numbers on their question sheet because they thought it was multiple choice problem .I\u2019d revised that lesson for a week and pretty much gave away all the problems that I was gonna ask on the test and all I got was circles .",

        "title": "Elementary Art Teacher Transitioning To High School. Any Advice Is Appreciated!",
        "body": "This might be an unusual post but I\u2019m sure someone here can offer advice or insight!\n\n\nI\u2019m looking for Advice/Tips/Help for an elementary art teacher transitioning to High School art?\n\nI\u2019ve taught elementary art for the past two years, and I think I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m able to succeed with the lack of structure, consistency, and numerous variables that influence my classroom. For this reason and others I am applying to teach art at different grade levels.\n\n\u2014 Background \u2014\n\n[I love all of my students. However, the constant changes and variables within elementary art as a \u201cspecials\u201d teacher is exhausting. Seeing students only once a week already makes my ability to connect with 500 students harder. But I believe my school (and Admin) is exacerbating the problem.\n\nMy first year teaching I had 20 classes (4 PreK) for 60 minutes with no breaks between when the classes arrived. Additionally as a Title I behaviors sometimes become a concern. \n\nI\u2019ve had significant progress this second year, but I feel like I\u2019m not getting to teach the amount of art content or produce the art classroom management routines that I would like. Each week I have homeroom teachers bringing multiple students to my class late because they had to finish something in their class. Or students getting pulled out or in due to various things. I\u2019ve had 32 kids placed in my classroom with no heads up multiple times due to class splitting. Students being pulled in and out of my classroom due to tutoring, test prep, late teachers, events, and other things outside of my control. Some days I\u2019ll have half the class missing and then they come back to my class at the end right before we begin cleaning up. \n\nI understand being flexible, but I feel as if these things have been excessive. But most importantly, these things significantly alter my ability to maintain structure and management in the classroom. All of the classroom procedures and routines that I\u2019ve created get sidelined because students are missing, late, absent, or being taken from the classroom.\n\nStudents recognize the lack of structure compared to their home room class. Kids need structure and consistency and at my current position I feel unable to provide it.]\n\nAnyways. I would like to teach in a space where I\u2019m able to be consistent with routines, expectations, student jobs, and build strong relationships with students in order to be successful as an art teacher. \n\nSo I\u2019m transitioning to high school art. Im not opposed to teaching middle school, but I would prefer high school because I want to do more long form and comprehensive art projects. But either way, I am looking for advice. \n\nI want to be able to teach less classes and focus on the students and content without constantly being interrupted by outside forces. I taught high school art during my student teaching and loved it. But chose elementary first because of my age..\n\nDo you think high school is a good move? If so do you have any advice about making the transition to high school art?",

        "body": "Hi teachers! I'm a high school senior. My school is K-12, so we seniors have this great opportunity to mentor a middle school class for \\~30 minutes a day. It's only during homeroom, but I'm really trying to build better relationships with these kids/practice my leadership because I'm thinking of teaching or taking on a similar leadership position.\n\nI mentor a 23-student 7th grade class and they are absolutely NUTS. Five years ago, I was watching Miraculous Ladybug\u2014these kids say swear words we don't understand and break pencils for fun. They hardly listen and are always shouting/fighting/throwing things around. Our teacher is great; she is very adaptable and can fluctuate between discipline and compassion, but she is a first-year teacher who is struggling with classroom management too. She has gotten through to them more times than I have and I know they don't have bad intentions; they are just very poorly influenced by the behavior of their older counterparts (underclassmen are very apathetic here).\n\nI'm having a lot of trouble getting this class to quiet down when I want to, and just having them respect me while remaining a role model for them. I can yell pretty loudly and still can't be heard over them\u2014and even if I am, I am always met with tons of retaliation and continued noise. When I communicate with them, most are really rude to me (i.e.\\* \"shut up\" \"come help me I'm losing patience\" and just generally saying no to anything I suggest).\n\nHowever, some of the kids are really sweet and even the biggest troublemakers show a glimmer of humanity sometimes. Like I said, they're just in a horrible environment and this is their way of fitting in. I have no idea how to get control over them when they're all screaming and fighting and arguing at the same time.\n\nThanks for any of your advice or ideas!\n\n\\*For context: I am not in the US; I attend an American school overseas, and the kids evade trouble by smack talking in their native language that our American teachers don't understand. I am not as fluent in this language either, despite being of the same nationality. I guess this has caused a student-to-student barrier since I can't retaliate in our native language, although they understand my English perfectly.",

I\u2019m an art teacher so I\u2019m very much in constant interaction with almost every single teacher, so I\u2019m constantly trying to keep these relationships balanced/in check if that makes sense.\n\nI taught for 4 years at one school where I was more on the hang out with coworkers outside of work, felt sort of in a \u201cgroup\u201d, and it was okay. In hindsight, there are some folks I befriended that I wish I would have steered clear of, but sometimes those things take time to show themselves. \n\nThen I had a child and switched to a new school and decided to approach with some of the fore mentioned things in mind. I decided I would be more reserved, ease into things with people, and strived to be thought of more \u201cprofessionally\u201d (still don\u2019t really know what that actually means to me). I felt more of a need to protect my time since having a child, and wanted to put very little emotional energy into the ins and outs of the job so I wouldn\u2019t get sucked into anything.\n\nI happen to be possibly transferring again this year to another school within the district, so I\u2019m left pondering that same thought like\u2026what kind of player do I want to be within this crowd? I did feel like my previous approach of being more guarded did make me feel sorta isolated and not completely myself? But I did feel like for the first time this year, I was not unhealthily invested in coworker relationships or feeling an overburdening sense of responsibility to my job. I came and I went home. But in turn, I feel that I lost a bit of the comradery.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m doing this all wrong. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking this too much. Or maybe I\u2019m not? Anyone else out there contemplate these things? What conclusions have you come to? Season me!",

They\u2019re concerned I\u2019m biased against christian students (literally ALL of my students are christian). Their student happens to barely be passing my class, which is where I think all of this is coming from. My VP asked me to just change the bio to \u201cjust avoid drama\u201d. \n\nThe complaint was made via phone, but I received an email about it. I also sent an email to my VP with highlights from our convo, and included the detail about changing my facebook bio; I asked them to confirm all the details of the email and they said yes in writing. I also took screenshots of our social media policy for teachers, which states nothing about religion. My social media profiles are completely private, and I don\u2019t put that I work at the school or that I\u2019m a teacher in general in any of my social media bios. I\u2019m assuming the parent recognized me from my profile picture. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time i\u2019ve experienced antisemitism at work (admin gave me shit for taking 2 holidays off). I\u2019m in a non union state and felt stuck. \n\nI didn\u2019t change the bio. I set up a meeting with my principal, and I brought everything I had in writing and the social media policy for the district. I laid it all out and just said that I was not changing my bio, I didn\u2019t not associate myself with the school on the internet, I broke no rules, and I was disappointed in the VP for not defending me. I was open and said I felt like I was now experiencing antisemitism at work. As soon as I mentioned the legality of the whole situation, my principal apologized profusely and said she would speak to the VP and the parents who complained. She told me it\u2019s always smart to keep social media pages private and that I did Not Have to change my bio. I got a formal apology from my VP earlier this week.\n\nThis is my first year teaching, and i\u2019m very proud of myself for standing my ground.",

While I don't argue that public school is a convenient aspect of society that does allow some time for our workforce to do their thing (though I admit this also has its issues), it does create a lot of annoyance for teachers.\n\nWell, darn it, a similar problem exists in the realm of virtual teaching. Many areas are well enough past the full pandemic school situation, so one would think that those still going the virtual route are committed to it, finding it the best fit for their situation.\n\nIt's just not true.\n\nWithout trying on purpose to be that heartless teacher that doesn't appreciate the struggles that come up in families, every year I have far too many families using virtual school as some sort of weird placeholder until they can get their lives on track. There comes a point where sympathy must be suspended and people really need to make their kids' education one of their priorities. \n\nI've had parents late to the game because they were oblivious to the fact their kids were supposed to be in school and didn't do anything until CPS bothered them about it.\n\nI've had parents who say their work lives don't give them the time to take their kid to school (who's watching the kid while you're at work?)\n\nI've had a parent who flat-out said they were going the virtual route so public school wouldn't report them for child abuse (Narrator: They were reported for child abuse by the virtual school). \n\nOn the more sympathetic route, I've had parents dealing with someone in the family in a serious medical situation where they really just want to do the bare minimum until they can devote more time to education. \n\nIt's all just frustrating and really messes with the idea that homeschoolers (who, to be fair, I generally admire and support) are actually on top of things. Goes to show you can make everything deliriously convenient and some people still can't handle it.",

        "body": "A few years ago, I completed a six-week Career Switcher program that I thought had prepared me well. The professors for it said, \"Don't worry that this program was short and didn't have a student teaching practicum; the school that hires you will teach you anything else you need to know.\" Then I stupidly accepted the first job offered to me, at a school in a wealthy area where the other teachers on that team had already been working together for at least ten years and they certainly didn't want to have to deal with mentoring me (I mean, I don't blame them.). I wasn't comfortable with the grade level or culture of the school either, but I ignored all my instincts in taking that job and then failed miserably throughout the year. The CS program didn't even teach me how to lesson plan and I was expected to plan every single lesson on my own at that school. \n\nNo surprise, I was informed in April that my contract wouldn't be renewed. I remember that I took the option that the principal said would make it easier for me to get hired by another school, which was resigning and not seeking unemployment. After that, I started working in a private preschool, where I've spent the past few years and have been successful enough that I'm the teacher who is asked to train all the new teachers. Meanwhile, I also went back to school for my Master's degree (in elementary education) and I'm almost finished with that. I've had a few short experiences with student teaching in public schools (not full-time yet, just like 25 hours one semester, 60 the next, etc.) and the teachers there said I did well (if they were being truthful). \n\nBut, as I get closer to graduation and seeking employment, I'm still afraid that my prior resignation in lieu of nonrenewal will screw me over. Is it truly common for first-year teachers to be nonrenewed and be able to find work again, even in HCOL areas where districts have more money to spend and may be pickier about hiring? Also, do I have to put that first school on my resume or would it be acceptable for me to leave it off, even if I still have to check the box about prior resignations on the application?",

My has lawyer told me that they could also transfer me to another campus, move me to another department, they could just leave me on AL until the end of the year and not renew my contract or they could pressure me to quit or I can go back to work and they would give me a growth plan.  And all of this gives me even more anxiety... haha \n\nI am more concerned as to what to do with the transition from having a job to who knows what is going to happen. I thought I had time but with this rumor, I think I have to change my plan or am I over reacting? And the end of the day, I don't want to go back to teaching... I am burned out and this is not good for me or the students... I have to go... should I just leave it to faith and take one day at a time?",

Apologies if this is not the right place for me to ask, or if I chose the wrong flair.\n\nI follow this sub a lot out of admiration for y'all and it kills me to see what looks like the majority of posts venting about how terrible the kids have been, how literacy/independence/social skills have fallen off a cliff the last 3 years, and how so many teachers have had the passion beaten out of them. I quit bus driving out of a similar frustration; it's obvious that a lot of school systems were built on a house of cards and Covid toppled them all.\n\nFrom what I've seen here and even from people in my own life (parents, teachers, etc.), it's clear that the high, middle, and older elementary kids have not recovered from covid. They lost some crucial years and are cripplingly behind in social skills, discipline, attention, the works. A lot of administrations don't have plans in place to catch them up or address... anything really, and would rather push them along to keep metrics up. Resources and support for both students and teachers seem limited or nonexistent. It fucking sucks. It really feels like the classes of 2022 though 2032 or so are gonna be a lost generation. \n\nI think I'm just grasping for a silver lining. Are the new kids in the system doing okay? Like the ones that are just now going into kindergarten/1st grade and those who will be there soon? Obviously a return to \"normalcy\" isn't a thing, but is there any chance at a recovery for those who didn't miss time due to the peak of the pandemic? Or hell, have any schools been able to heal that wound? Like, have any current students been able to regain the ground they lost from 2020-2021?\n\nI guess generally to the Pre-K/Kindergarten teachers, how are you guys doing? Again, all of  this is just out of admiration for y'all and I'm looking for hope.",

        "title": "Is getting a Master's in Special Education / Teaching worth it?",
        "body": "I'm currently in my 2nd year teaching (under the Provisional Teacher Program at my school district), and am supposed to complete my remaining 350 hours of my alternate route in order to get my Standard Certificate. I teach special ed and have CEs in Students with Disabilities, ESL, and English. \n\nMy mentor advised me to keeping going down the alternate route and receive my Special Ed teaching degree, but I just don't think it's worth my time, money, or effort. \n\nMy primary concern is the fact the out-of-touch braindead admins in my district seem to think teachers are made out of money, considering teachers *used* to GET PAID to go to grad school where I teach, whereas nowadays every teacher has to pay out of pocket for more education, and only receives a small percentage of what they shelled out as reimbursement for all their classes. This coupled with my student debt from my undergrad degree, and the low to negative ROI often reported for teachers with Master's degrees (either because they fall deeper into student debt or simply don't see massive gains in income like in other fields) infuriates and depresses me because I feel like I won't be getting my money's worth and will waste years of my life for basically nothing. \n\nMaster's degrees where I work at only give teachers a small $7K boost or less in salary, which is only amounts to an extra $350 per paycheck every two weeks. Meanwhile, I will be spending thousands even at the cheapest school with the alternate route program (which is already suffering from a financial crisis and has had to fire staff, cut programs, etc, which makes me worry about its future viability as an institution).\n\nI don't even see myself working in special ed for more than 5 years at this point (crossing my fingers on Teacher Loan Forgiveness), with the stress I have experienced and my colleagues have experienced dealing with BS inclusivity measures for unaccountable special ed students with a history of misbehavior and home problems, and the shit I endured my previous year as a teacher (stuck with a group of truly awful students who DID NOT want to learn anything, cursed at me, insulted me, made fun of me, and generally made my life a living hell + want to quit teaching). \n\nTeaching has sucked out the love for education I had a student. I'm less interested in grad school now than in the past and am literally only concerned now with financial freedom, not dying poor, getting out of debt, and feeling useful to society + pursuing my actual passions in life. \n\nShould I stick it out and get the degree or get out and seek other options? I don't necessarily think I have a choice in the matter since I have to get my degree in two to three years anyways, and I suppose I could pair up the teaching degree with a content area subject I would actually enjoy (like my mentor recommended, since English, Creative Writing, or Art were my favorite subjects in school).\n\nThis is what I get for going to art school to pursue my dreams, instead of majoring in STEM or tech or law like my parents strongly recommended I do for financial stability.",

And all these parents could talk about was how traumatized and frightened their children were as their hearts break to see what their kids have to go through and live with in this day in age. WHAT ABOUT ABBY?!! How about the over-whelmed, stressed teacher who was actually injured by the weapon. I remembered only one parent expressing her empathy towards Abby in one news video, and that was it. Who else watched videos of the school committee meetings? It just seemed the parents didn't acknowledge her at all, only about how sad their (unharmed) kids have to live in fear. Were there other parents who supported/empathized with her? All in all, my main issue was the blatant disregard on what teachers are going through because it was only the kids people care about.",

        "title": "Can they make me do this?",
        "body": "Recently, I got an e-mail about a professional development opportunity. The e-mail said they had sent an earlier e-mail about an earlier date for the same course, and that it was mandatory for all teachers new to the district to take this course, so if I didn't take the earlier one, I needed to take this one.\n\nI double-checked the old e-mail - I did receive one, so they weren't lying, but it hadn't said it was mandatory, so I mostly ignored it.\n\nThe reason that I'm angry about this, though, is when I went to sign up for this course and write it down on my planner, I learned that it was on a SATURDAY and it was SEVEN HOURS LONG. Same with the earlier date for the course. Except this one is being held in March.\n\nMy school district gets one week off in February and our Spring Break is in April right after STAAR testing. There is one teacher workday between the two breaks, but no other breaks. No half days, no 3-day weekends, etc. And during that time, I'm already going to be slammed. Both of my subjects are tested, so our classes will be suffocatingly boring and stressful test prep. I'm going to be forced to give a couple of after school test prep courses from 3 to 5:30 two times. I have to proctor the TELPAS test, and lose planning periods even when I'm not because I have to cover for the teachers who are. Then we take the STAAR test in early April right before break.\n\nI bring all that up to show how stressed and overwhelmed I will be from February 27th to April 6th. This is why I've been saving my sick days - so I can get myself through this time. I need my weekends more than ever, but they want to take one of my Saturdays away for 7 hours of professional development? And there was no mention of any kind of additional compensation. My weekends are sacred to me - I never bring work home on the weekends, and would rather stay for hours after school on a Friday getting work done so that the moment I walk out those doors, I don't have to even think about work until I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nThis professional development involves ESLs. I'm ESL certified, and when I got my certification, it was mandatory for me to go to a couple of training courses. But I didn't mind; you know why? BECAUSE IT WAS DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY. The school I taught at at the time hired subs to cover my class for those two days.\n\nHalf of this is a rant, but half of it is wanting advice. I responded to the e-mail sent by an AP, asking if we would get financial compensation. No response. Are they allowed to force us into mandatory professional development on a Saturday like this without any additional compensation? It sounds like with most jobs, if your job requires you to go to training outside of your normal work hours, you are supposed to be compensated. Does this not apply to teaching? I live in Texas and work at a regular public high school if this helps any.",

I specifically took the job to get out of the classroom. In short, I\u2019m serving as a special ed consultant. I LEA meetings, finalize paperwork, assist with behaviors, and do a lot of other things here and there to serve as a leader for the sped teachers in our building.\n\nRecently, one of our learning support teachers has not been doing their job. I essentially took over case management duties. Now, the teacher is out on short term disability and I am being asked to plan, do case management duties, and now there\u2019s a possibility that I will be the one teaching too. \n\nI\u2019m heartbroken.

For some context, I\u2019m currently pregnant and will be on maternity leave August-January, so I can\u2019t really leave right now as I have a lot of sick days saved up and will need them for pay while on leave.

Marked as humor because IDK what else to do! \n\nThe facts right now; you can fail everything, not turn in one single assignment, not participate, read, do homework, pass a single test, do any classwork, get into fights, physically assault others (teachers and other students), steal Chromebooks, steal tablets, steal from each other, extortion, bribery, quid-pro-quo, sexting, it goes on and on, and continue on to High School. There are (literally) no consequences.  (Yes, parents are contacted at every step of the way)\n\nOver my 10 years at the MS level I've personally experienced the following situations:\n\nStudents leave campus for the day (while the district is still technically responsible for them until they get home) go to the downtown library area and start fights off campus, again the district is still responsible, this student get expelled from current school site only to end up at a different MS in the SAME(!!!) district, this time with an adult chaperone, whoop-de-fucking-do!\n\nThis fight went virial (because of course phones), it was brutal, physical, one kid stomping on another. Still in the same school district. No, I don't have the link, and I won't watch, it I'm sure you can look it up from my description.\n\nAnother example, kid comes into MS as a 6th grader, I tell all of the Admin, case manager, his ELA teachers, etc. This kid can't read, they pass him on to 7th grade, his case file (yes he's sped) is massive by 7th grade. He continues to fail up, but whatever. He is suspended form school 47 (yes that's correct) times during his MS career. He eventually gets to HS and he of course gets into trouble right away, he ends up bringing a gun to school (thankfully didn't use it or hurt anyone) and is sent to juvenile detention. (Eye roll) He's thankfully out now, and \"seems\" to be doing better, still can't read though.\n\nNext student, and this is who I'm mainly thinking of with this story, literally does NO work, he did not do one damn thing! I never, not once, got any work from him - at all. He was rarely gone from school, just sat a did nothing all day long. I taught this kid for a whole year and failed ever single quarter. He did this for all of his classes, and guess what? Yup, went on to HS. No idea what happened to him there.\n\nThis isn't a one off either, it's been happening with much more frequency! I've now had dozens of students that get away with doing NOTHING, and still they pass them upwards.\n\nI've had countless students over my 10 years as a MS teacher that don't do ANYTHING, and we pass them on to HS with a fucking, \"MS graduation ceremony\" . I don't have a stronger word to use than utter ridiculousness to describe how woefully idiotic MS has become!\n\nWe've had fights every week, we've had kids destroy the bathrooms, we've done the RTI, we done that stupid ass PBIS, we do the even dumber advisory (aka teacher trap) period. I've had it. They don't give a shit about anything. Speaking of shit, they also loved to smear it on the floor, walls, write their names in it, you name it!  They all think they're comedians or going to pro sports. - BAHAHAHA!\n\nI'm laughing at this point because I can't do anything else. MS is utterly broken, no two ways about it. Until they fix the whole, \"you can fail upwards and, not able to read grade level thing\", I don't know what to do! \n\nI teach HS now, it's better, the phones are worse, they're 100 percent addicted to them, no doubt. On the bright side they can't graduate without passing the required classes and getting the required amount of credits. At least at the HS level we can hold that over their heads.\n\nI'll never teach MS again, I'll quit education all together before I teach that bullshit again.",

This student is not a senior, but it is likely that some of my seniors knew them, and are affected greatly by their passing. They were rather well known in the school, and were a positive face to everyone they met. \n\nI'm a first year teacher, and I did not know the student personally, but I have dealt with the death of a friend when I was in school, and it was the worst time of my life. I remember shutting down, and my grade suffered for a while. I want to have a very open and honest dialogue with my students, even if the vast majority of them did not know the student personally. \n\nI would like to approach the topic professionally, give students the advice that counselors are available, and maybe even allow them a day to recoup should they need it, but I am very nervous about doing so. What do I say? What resources can I provide? How can I help them should they need it. Even if it helps one student, I'd rather give them all I can than push on with a unit that most likely couldn't care less about right now. \n\nI also recognize that for some students, the schedule and routine route are more likely going to help them overcome some grief, but I still want to address them dealing with grief. \n\nAny advice?",

I am a prek teacher of the deaf in a public school district, however our DHH program is experiencing some changes and I don't know if I will be guaranteed a position in our preschool next year. I have only ever taught early childhood grades (taught Kindergarten special education for a couple of years, but 8 years of experience as a preschool teacher of the deaf). I am considering moving into the general special education space in the future, but still want to focus on early childhood in some way. And although I am certified in my state to teach special education, my masters degree is in deaf ed and i already have a graduate certificate in general early childhood education. I live in a highly educated, very competitive area, and would like to at least have a graduate certificate in either special education, early childhood special education, early intervention, maybe even special education supervision, etc. to expand and substantiate my knowledge of special education when applying for jobs (and unfortunately to also not get multiple questions from parents on if I'm qualified to teach general sped.. like I said, it's a very competitive area). \n\nI'm looking for a program that is 12-15 credits maximum, and ideally online. Also, it would be great if the courses went beyond \"foundations of special education\" or \"special education law\" because between previous courses and PDs, those topics are overkill for me at this point. Does anyone have any recommendations of graduate programs or just areas to look into that might be what I'm looking for? Thank you!!",

        "body": "This is my first year teaching and it has been frustrating to say the least. I work in a title one school which definitely holds an agenda that does not meet the expectations I was told to have as an educator. My aids don\u2019t respect me due to my age. I have students lying on me left and right. My administration will not support anything I do in the classroom. They say I need to work harder to build relationships in my classroom and make my activities more engaging! I\u2019ve been given the lowest students in their grades to educate on Biology and many students have made excellent strides to bettering themselves. \n\nThen a new teacher comes to my department. She has only been working at my school for a month and a half. She is very negative and brings the whole team down. She teaches older students than mine and constantly brags about how much better for students are. I make most of the materials she uses and I have taught her class on multiple occasions because she could not teacher the content. \n\nWhat do I see yesterday?!?! A certificate on her door from the principal telling her what an excellent job she has done. \n\nI was infuriated to say the least! Her students are honors students that are in 12th grade in extracurricular classes. How course they are more well behaved and interested. While I teacher all 10th graders going through puberty and not everyone loves science the way I do. \n\nThat was definitely a frustrating end to a long week! When you work 3 times as hard than her since August and she gets this kind of recognition.",

It's not too bad.  (It didn't give the sophistication point the college board did on a question, but it could recognize what the rubric said and what the kid wrote.)\n\n  \nI tutor physics so I thought I'd try it on AP Physics Mechanics. I think I killed ChatGPT. It started blinking, paused, died and printed out an error message. The question was graphics intensive, and I suspect ChatGPT can't deal with that. \n\nBut I thought some of the AP teachers might want to give ChatGPT a shot for their subjects. If it works fairly well, you'll be able to guide your own students to a resource that gives them some sort of shot at grading their essays. They might still want to have another student give their opinion on grading the essay, but I know one of the most difficult thing for students studying is later checking how well they did point-wise. So this could be useful.\n\n(I have no idea what the right flair for this is!)",

One kid is so far behind in math that we have him fill out hundreds charts during our focus lessons because he can\u2019t keep up with GLM and needs to learn to count. I also have another kid who can\u2019t read or write to the point where on his assignments he has to dictate what he wants to say and one of the teachers writes or types it for him. They do meet with math and literacy interventionists but I don\u2019t think they could do anything that would get them to the point of even being near GLM by the end of the year.\n\nI really did not realize how bad this issue was until I spoke to a friend who teaches 7th grade and she said her kids have some of the same issues as well! \n\nI really do not understand why they are advancing thee kids to the next grade. If the kid is consistently below GLM for the entire year, who is making the call to advance them? It makes for such challenging classroom environments as you literally have to prepare different lessons and coursework for the kids who are so below GLM. \n\nI remember when I went to elementary school you could literally repeat grades if you did not do well and it was happening ALL the time. I don\u2019t see any kids repeating grades at all anymore. What is going on?",

The days I don\u2019t have duty in the morning, I have a break from 9:50-10:05, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s enough time to pump anyway. The only teacher I know whose pumped at school is a music teacher with a more broken up schedule, so it wasn\u2019t a problem for her. I\u2019m also concerned about the privacy issue. I\u2019m able to lock my door, but oftentimes students and other staff need to come into the room or talk to me. I\u2019m not sure a \u201cdo not disturb, I\u2019m pumping\u201d sign would be appropriate haha. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Ever since, about 2 other teachers from that school have followed my lead (1200 students, only high school, small district).  I went to my old line of work for a retailer that just announced lay offs this week, so now I'm back in the classroom.  I subbed for a few middle schools in the big district where I live and it was actually fun.  I talked to my neighbors and they were impressed by my classroom management skills because these kids weren't loud at all.  I asked them for their opinion on the district that inspired me to quit and they said that it has a reputation for doing that to teachers.  The other teachers I reached out to that left said they don't miss it.  One went back to *Tampa* and said it was an upgrade.  Basically I went from being treated like the worst teacher they ever hired to \"can you sign a contract tomorrow?\"\n\nI was tired yesterday but I felt fulfilled in a way that Industrial Maintenance could *never* fulfill me.",

        "body": "So my last school school, as well as its district, are real shit show. Some of you might have seen my post in the past about when I left the vice principal position there and the new school administration didn't take it so well.\n\nWell, I've been so busy lately that I hadn't really chatted with any of the people from that school in the past month or two. Life, right? Well, last night I ran into a couple of coworkers at TGI Fridays. They asked me to join them and promised me some fantastic information. How could I refuse?\n\nSo apparently the principal of their school, a recently demoted assistant superintendent, has been gone for the last 2 days. Apparently at the Wednesday staff meeting she made the comment that there were currently five members of the staff who were pregnant. She then mentioned that she is struggling to find people to be able to cover the maternity leave for the teachers that I'll be out before the school year ends. And also that it would be difficult to find coverage at the beginning of the school year for anyone who's going to miss the first few weeks or month of it. She then said something really really stupid. She said:\n\n \"If anyone here is planning on trying to have a kid or planning on doing anything that could get you pregnant, can you please talk to me first so we can see if it'll fit into the schedule.\"\n\nNow, maybe she meant it as a joke. However, she's not very well liked it that school and that was enough for several members of the staff, including two of the pregnant ones, to go down to HR and complain right after the meeting.\n\nThursday morning the principal was not there and they were told by the instructional coordinator that she would be off campus until further notice and all inquiries and problems should be directed towards her instead. Come friday, still not back. Then some people did some digging and it turns out that the principal may be on a suspension for making comments of a sexual nature towards the staff and asking them to coordinate their sex schedules with her.\n\nAs far as my former co-workers know, they have no idea when she's coming back, but her instructional coordinator has already told them that many of her meetings next week are canceled and that she'll be taken over several of the planned meetings.\n\nSo as a warrant to all administrators out there, don't ask us to tell you when we plan to have sex.",

        "body": "I teach an advanced class and we are in second semester.  \n\nI was approached by student before school with his best friend.  \"I was talking to my counselor about my schedule for next year.  And she said that the schedule I want next year can happen if we can somehow correct that 'D'.\"\n\nI probed for more information.  \"What do you mean by ***correct***?\"  I don't know if the student came up with that word or if his counselor did.  Regardless, the implication is I'm knowingly screwing up or even committing fraud.\n\nHe gave up pretty quick when I kept asking him explain ***correct***.  \n\nIn truth, his first semester grade percentage was F and it wasn't within rounding to a D.  Giving him the D was a subjective call based on effort and a low D on the final.  I do my best to set the percentages for the grades, but the system isn't perfect.  Once in a while, I make a subjective call to the benefit of the student.  \n\nThe student should not have enrolled in my class.  Early first semester, I encouraged the student to consider dropping my class.  He just wasn't ready for the rigor.  But he chose to remain because his friends are in advanced - despite advice from his previous teacher (\"He had a C with me last year,\" was the refrain when I asked his previous teacher).  \n\nI guess what I'm getting at is ... in high school, kids experience peer pressure of all kinds that can lead to some bad decisionmaking.  When it comes to choosing classes, it is natural to push a kid.  But there were signs this kid was overwhelmed before getting to me. ***Correct***  the grade should have been preceded by ***correct*** the schedule.  \n\nInstead, the teacher becomes the villain.  Why does there have to be a villain when it comes to grades?  Grades show the level of mastery attained.  A 'D' shows he has a minimal amount of proficiency.  I recognize that grades are so consequential - or at least we perceive it that way - when it comes to college prospects and scholarships.  But I'm signing my name on the document that has his grades.  There has to be some integrity here.  Did I do the right thing in entering 'D' and not 'F' for this student?  I think so.  \n\nAnd that sense of integrity has to go into the thinking of any student, no matter how well intentioned, who thinks an unsatisfactory grade needs to be ***correct***ed by the teacher who evaluated his proficiency.  \n\nI've been pressured before by students and parents to change grades.  This instance is far less straining that previous instances.  It was merely a conversation with a student with no parent/admin conferences or attorneys involved (yet).  But the feelings of those past episodes remain.",

The course also has a crazy range of abilities, from students who get Fs and Ds to students in AP classes. \n\nThere's these three girls that sit about an inch away from my desk, and I can hear all their conversations. I can already tell they will be causing me issues as they talk non-stop and do nothing in all of their classes. Essentially yesterday I was having everyone do make-up work, and I had already walked around the class to check in with every group a few times at this point (including them). All of a sudden, it sounds like one of them is talking on her phone. For me, it sounds like the \"ringleader\" and I'm about 99% sure it's her, only because her back is facing me. Eventually a bunch of the other students in the class start looking at them and are noticing, and they're looking at me too clearly being like \"wtf\". I don't want to look like a pushover, so I get up and I ask them what are they doing. They act dumb and say nothing and I reply \"canceling your gym membership?\" and they start laughing. \n\nThe rest of this is somewhat a blur because I was upset about it yesterday, but the ringleader shows me her phone (she wasn't on a call, though she has headphones on) and starts giving me an attitude telling me I'm accusing her of something she wasn't even doing. They're telling me they weren't on their phones, then she tells me that she wasn't even talking (which was when I ask them if they thought I was born yesterday because I'm sitting right behind them) and they deny it of course. Until one of the other girls claims she was on the phone because she was cancelling a membership for her friend. I told them either way, you're not supposed to be doing this in class.\n\nIt gets heated, because the ringleader is still acting like a disrespectful hot head, and I say in my calmest voice \"look, no one's in trouble, I'm not mad, but you can't be doing that in class\". I did not apologize even though I feared I did get the wrong girl, because I felt like she was just gaslighting me. The girls stayed quiet the rest of class and that was it. \n\nWe do have a week long vacation and I'm sure they'll barely remember anything that happened when we came back, but I'm worried about how I should deal with this going forward since I will be teaching them until June. I don't know how to balance that fine line of having the rapport with the students, while also not looking like a pushover in front of the entire class.",

I'm a student intern in a graduate program (elementary school) with experience in subtitue in the district and grade I'm interning at and also tutored so I've had experience with students.\n\nAfter being in my internship which is a year long (I'm in a intensive year program). I'm constantly going back between I want to teach or not and typically more to the not side. The reasons are for not feeling like I  want to:\n\n1. I'm struggling with students that just need more (equity). I'm just learning how to teach and my mentor warns me how I will always have students like this. They have major behavior problems, need so much extra support, coddling, handholding, rewards for doing anything at all, give them love when they are still being naughty etc. I won't go into details for the certain students behavior but that's the gist. It is exhausting, overstimulating for me and it emotional drains me.\n2. I feel like parents are enablers for how students show up at school. It seems like parents don't discipline or set expectations or standards. It is so different than how I  was raised (mom always said, if the other kids can do it then you can to etc etc.). It seems that the teachers and school tries to please parents and get them to like us instead even if it's not our fault. They get to complain or they except us to teach them how to be in all aspects of life.\n3. I'm finding out about budget cuts and how your position isn't stable if you are a new teacher. Also that there isn't as many openings here (WA) as we were led on to be.\n4. There is so much expectations in the curriculum to do but also you need to add in fun things for the kids like art or something for example but there isn't anytime. \n5. I help buy snacks a lot but we rely on parents to bring them and if they don't then the teachers have to get them weekly.\n\nI like where I am at now because I'm trying to be positive so I show up the best for my class, do extra things and do feel accepted as a teacher too. But I am so drained as a intern and stress even thinking if this what it looks like when I'm a teacher.\n\nI'm already feeling like I just want to LT sub after. Any advice or input? Am I crazy for feeling these things lol Be honest. I'm all ears :)  Felt good to get this off my chest.",

Most of the kids are usually excited to see me and will stop to say hi or talk. At break yesterday (lunch), some student saw me and came to say hi. The teacher I share the class with saw some students talking to me and rushed them all back inside. One girl stayed to keep talking to me. This teacher then asked why the student was there and they said they wanted to ask me a question. The teacher said \u201cit better be a 5 second question\u201d and walked inside the class, dismissing me completely.\n\nLater the same day, one of our students had come to the room I was subbing in to ask me about the prize I promised them because it was their last day at our school. So I walked back with the student into my class, to grab my prize bin to let her choose one. This was one minute before dismissal and the teacher was already dismissing students to get dressed. When some students saw me in the class, they got excited and came to say hi and they were asking why I was there and all that.

I have a 30 minute lunch break that is often cut down to 20-25mins by the time I actually sit DOWN to eat.\n   * The children are usually all gone by 6pm, but, I have to stay and clean up, and again, plan, respond to e-mails, fill out order request forms, etc. Things I'm not given time to do during the day. I stay until usually 6:30 or 7pm, and then I walk to my car, which is the last one in the dark parking lot, as everyone else has now left.\n\nI am most often the first one to arrive, and the last one to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's get into PAY:\n\nParaprofessional position (Salaried):\n\n* Annual: $22,059.30\n* Monthly: $1,838.28\n\nDirector of After School (Hourly):\n\n* Before completing my Director's Course: $21.05/hour\n* After Completing my Director's Course: $25.58/hour\n\nThis is what was quoted to me personally by the school's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nI have to give more context to the hourly pay though. Not only is it absolutely bizarre to me that a DIRECTOR is an 'hourly' position (as the type of work, amount of work, etc. exceeds what should be expected of an hourly worker. As I spend hours at home cutting, laminating, planning, etc. Not to mention the paperwork I do before and after school).\n\nFor the first four months of this hourly position, I only marked my hourly payable time as \"3pm-6pm\" on my timesheet, because it was heavily implied to me that the only billable hours for my work was contingent upon supervising the children (meaning that my work outside of supervision was not billable or payable work hours....).\n\nIn January, I put my foot down, and I started including ALL of my hours, including the few nights I would be working there until 8pm or 9pm at night, alone, if I had a major project or instillation to do. I've built cabinets, I've put my entire classroom together from scratch. I started, the year with an empty, unlicensed, unusable room, forced to sit in the cafeteria for the first half of the school year because \"they didn't want me in the room yet.\"\n\nI think enough teachers expressed their distaste and concern at how I was being treated that administration and the principal finally conceded that it was indeed time to move into the classroom, licensing or not. They really wanted it to be an after school \"program\" and not afterschool \"care\" (which is what it currently is). However, in the best interest of the students well being and my personal sanity, I was granted permission to enter and use the classroom after the winter break.\n\nAfter putting the room together, I was exhausted. I have put together and incredibly comprehensive, teamwork oriented, hands-on STEM focused after school program with seasonal activities and education-oriented, self-interest guided learning.\n\n**My program has been at maximum enrollment for most of the school year (25 children).**\n\nHowever I've had to deal with several unsavory things as follows:\n\n* My monthly pay working 60+ hours a week **is around only $2,400**\n   * (Estimated breakdown:)\n   * (After School Director - $1,214/month)\n   * (Paraprofessional - $1,838/month)\n   * $500 is taken out before I receive my paycheck for my health insurance premium \n* Due to having my access to the after school budget thwarted at the start of the year in almost every way, and no one taking the time to work with me on how to access it, I have invested well over $1,500 of my own money into making this program successful and fun for the kids.\n* Parents who have donated checks to my program (when learning I was pouring my own already limited money into it because I actually care about the kids) would address checks to the school, and then the school would take the checks, knowing I spent my money on the program, and I'd never see a penny of it.\n* Even when I completed my \"Director's Course\" and was supposed to have a fairly substantial bump in my hourly pay for the Director's position ($21.05/hour -&gt; $25.58/hour), there was no noticeable increase in my income. It's remained in the same bracket of $2,300-$2,500/month.\n* When I submitted my timesheet to include my \"real hours\" in January, I was then slapped with \"so, we're going to shave 5 hours off your other's position's salary, so you're not 'double dipping', but don't worry, you'll make more money!\" So far, it doesn't at all look that way...  \nThey basically reduced my pay for not continuing to put in free work hours and asking that I'm paid for the things that I do.\n* The lead operations administrator is really rude to me, and talks to me like she's picking gum off the bottom of her shoe any time she interacts with me. She treats me the way you'd expect a boomer to insult a millennial on sight but she's probably only 10 years older than me. She's just rude no matter how docile, polite, accommodating, apologetic, etc. I am.  \nAny time I ask her a question, it's like she rolls her eyes with her entire body and soul.\n* There's another International Saturday school that uses our school's building and they pay us and help us with our building's mortgage to do that, but they tear apart teacher rooms, use our stuff, draw on our white boards with permanent marker, they got paint on the wall and floor of my classroom as well as taking some of my personal belongings. Pretty much everyone in the school hates them and wishes they weren't using our stuff. Teachers have to spend an extra hour prepping their rooms on Friday to make them \"other school proof\" and even then those assholes find a way to wreck people's shit.\n   * After four months of them wrecking my stuff, breaking my expensive stem stuff (like my snap circuits), etc. because I had no storage since **half of my classroom is a food pantry that the lead operations admin put there.**\n      * They basically anticipated that my program wasn't going to be shit, because the person who managed it last year had an enrollment of around 11 kids, and the parents who enrolled their kids in it didn't even want them there, there just wasn't a better or more convenient option. My school didn't realize when they hired me they hired Miss Frizzle and I was actually going to care enough to make something GOOD. So, based on that assumption, before even seeing my work or what I could do that school year, they used the bonus room inside my classroom as a food pantry, effectively robbing me of half my classroom space that was intended **for 25 children.**\n      * I was eventually given a key to this room (once the principal demanded it because she was tired of seeing my stuff destroyed), so I could store all my classroom's belongings in there on Fridays, so that the other international school that came on Saturday's couldn't mess with my stuff. This made the operations admin VERY unhappy... as that's 'her' food pantry (in MY classroom).\n      * There is food in this \"pantry\" that is literally already expired. No one uses it because it is on the first floor of the school building in a highly visible area. It is very much a \"hey look, we're helping poor people\" visual thing, and as someone who IS poor, and has been DESTITUTE in college before, I can tell you why people don't use it: **No one wants to be their fucking advertising billboard. It's embarrassing. Being poor is embarrassing. And nothing about that room is discrete or accommodating for an 'invisible in-and-out' in anyway.** It's literally placed to be as public and on display as possible. It is very much a self-serving ego appearance thing as far as I can tell. And it's robbing me of valuable classroom space in the process.  \nWhen I professionally and politely phrased this to the principal, she agreed, but the CFO told me \"I needed to be considerate of others' feelings.\" I'm sorry? What about my feelings? What about half of my classroom that's missing? What about the literal stress that comes with having 20-25 screaming children in a classroom that has enough room for 15 kids because half of it is a completely useless food pantry? Excuse me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm basically like, at a breaking point here. I'm getting so close to reaching that straw that will break the Camel's back with some of these people. The principal goes up to bat for me A LOT. I think she sees the actual value I have to offer as someone who is genuinely *passionate* about education and about the kids, but I'm being kneecapped left and right by the rest of the administration. However, I'm getting the feeling the principal isn't who's actually in charge and it's annoying and sad.\n\nI want to know if I'd be out of line for requesting/doing the following:\n\n* Requesting a $500-$700 raise; making BOTH my positions be salary and not hourly, and also now making enough money where as a single, unmarried, 100% independent young woman, I can live just at or right above the poverty line. (I think for working 60+ hours... that's not out of line to want)\n* **The food pantry gets moved the fuck OUT of my room. Period.** I get that entire space that was built and intended for me to use anyway before the operations admin commandeered it for her feel-good self ego project that had the best of intentions but was made to make her feel good, not actually help the community in the way it needs.  \nThere is literally a completely unused \"Multi-purpose room\" that is always empty with the lights off on the 3rd floor of the same building near the fire escape stairs which allows for a very discrete exit by any families who happen to need something from the pantry to come quietly and leave quietly and privately.\n* If I'm declined both of these things (like, I don't even get ONE of them), I go to a news station or other news outlet to share basically what challenges educators are now facing and further highlighting why our lovely shithole country is in such an education crisis :)   \nbecause of bullshit like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Questions? Similar Experiences? Please share :)",

        "body": "In some of my classes (7th grade), I have pretty much resorted to spoonfeeding because it feels like the only way to get anything done *at all*. We will read an average of 2.5 textbook pages together as a class (which they don't really stay quiet for, but I at least make the attempt), and then I will give them about ten questions to complete over that reading selection. They can use their book, they can work in groups, and I'll tell them the pages numbers we just read. \n\nAnd still I will have students tell me that they can't find the answers and want me to point out exactly where they are for them. I feel like three or fewer pages is a limited enough range that I should be able to tell them to figure it out (or, even less charitably, that they haven't looked hard enough). But when they ask that, I always feel like I have to give them more guidance (narrowing it down to a specific page or a specific paragraph) - because what if I really *am* being unreasonable and expecting too much of them? First of all, am I? Second of all, if I'm not, is there a way to politely communicate to them that they need to be a little more self-sufficient when up to this point I've been a bit of a snowplow teacher? Or do I maybe need to do some whole group instruction over reading strategies?\n\nI had a student tell me yesterday that they don't like/aren't good at needing to find things - they want to know exactly where to look for them. The implied suggestion seemed to be that because they don't like doing it, I should stop asking them to do it.",

I have this on video. I\u2019ve showed and told my landlord everything that\u2019s happened so far, but she\u2019s unable to do anything because of the laws associated with protecting tenants. \n\nThis woman is tormenting me.

School is just a social event and a playground. I don't have kids of my own so I'm learning how to teach and be a parent at the same time to walking/talking hormones. \n\nI hate to be a \"back I'm my day\" guy but back in the mid-90s when I was a kid in middle school we knew when to play, converse and to \"turn it off\" and focus when the teacher said ok it's time to pay attention, or at least be quiet and not interrupt.\n\nMy 2nd and 6th period is off the chain, and it sucks because we do block scheduling and they're in there for nearly two hours. I can deal with two or three kids with behavioral problems, but when half of the class is 504, IEP, ADHD, etc it's too much. Individually they're cool, but together they're feral. It was so bad yesterday I just said 'f'k it' to myself and cut instruction to write referrals. I'd rather deal with my honors class that has 34 students than my lunch period with 20 where half the class has the aforementioned issues.\n\nI made teacher of the month for January and already questioning if I should even continue in the education field. I love my admins and co-workers but the behavior of the students is just out of control. It's like they aren't scared of consequences, or their parents for that matter. I call their parents, send them to the counselor's office, then write referrals, they get sent home for three days and come back doing the same thing, rinse and repeat. It's a campus wide problem, every teacher that I've talked to say the same thing about their behavior. \n\nI've been thinking to make a suggestion to the principal to bring back ISS, Saturday school, detention, etc instead of sending them home for three days for everything (because that's like a vacation to them). \n\nSorry for the long text, I just had to vent. I worked in parole/probation as an officer for fourteen years and never felt the kind of frustration that I had yesterday.",

        "body": "Hello, parent/substitute teacher here. I was wondering if anyone has experience teaching in a Waldorf school, and their general takeaway from it. Having subbed at our kids preschool, I\u2019m left feeling worried about some unchecked behaviors in the kids, fearing that the general lack of accountability will only get worse as he ages into the school system. The private option nearby is Waldorf. \n\nWe moved to a fairly rural part of Vermont with our toddler, and are slowly getting to know the vibe of district. It\u2019s been tough gleaning how other teachers feel about the public school, though. We have a little over a year to decide where our son will go for elementary. We\u2019ve been considering budgeting for the Waldorf option, in part due to my anxieties around the behavioral issues in public education, but also because our son has a very imaginative streak, and I could see him thriving in a classroom where those traits are fostered. We are pretty strict about screen time, and love what we\u2019ve read about their approach to the arts. \n\nThat said, we are not at all what you\u2019d consider woo woo, and I wonder to what degree the esoteric vibe of the school necessitates that way of thinking? \n\nJust wondering if any of y\u2019all have experiences teaching Waldorf, and your takeaways from it. The r/Waldorf seems overwhelmingly pro, but I obviously wonder if that\u2019s a biased sub.",

Keep in mind the majority of our students come from rich backgrounds where they don't see the school as something important.\n\nAny tips would be appreciated.",

        "body": "I teach kindergarten and just started this position before winter break. I didn\u2019t take over for an existing classroom, but rather a new unit was created and I received a few students from each existing classroom. I also have received most of the new students to the school.\n\nLong story short, one of my students had some really extreme behavior problems the first month or so. After finally getting it under control for a few weeks, now it seems like there are other students popping up to take his place.\n\nStudent 1: Was shouting all day long, running around, climbing on tables, throwing things, biting/hitting me, shouting \u201cfuck\u201d across the classroom, etc. Displayed these behaviors at his previous school as well. I was totally out of my league with this one at first, but he has since mellowed out quite a bit and I have a behavior chart that I use with him every day. I also communicate with mom every day and send her a picture/explanation of the chart as she requested  (although she doesn\u2019t always look at it). He really can be a sweet kid, and from what I understand he had some major transitions at home while also having to go to a new classroom at school, and I was genuinely celebrating his progress. However, he became more amped up this week after the other students\u2019 behaviors and tried to flip a bench over/punch me.\n\nStudent 2: Very sweet boy, but absolutely cannot sit down to save his life. Often laying on top of tables, grabbing people\u2019s things, etc. Also puts absolutely everything in his mouth\u2014his shoes, pencils and erasers (literally found bits of metal from the ends laying on the floor so I don\u2019t give him new pencils anymore), ruins his shirts all the time from chewing on them, etc. He is also sick all the time and gets spit/snot everywhere and missed half the month of January. He was super amped up this week and was running around, jumping to grab our flag, standing on chairs, turning desks over, ripping things out of others\u2019 arms\u2014types of things I\u2019ve never seen from him before. Have spoken to parents as they were the ones to actually bring up seeing a doctor, but are also making excuses and are defensive.\n\nStudents 3 and 4: mean to other kids, are either ultra engaged or refuse to do anything, one tried to leave the classroom numerous times, swear, \u201cget to do whatever they want at home,\u201d make lots of comments like \u2018this is boring,\u2019 \u2018I said no,\u2019 \u2018I want to go home,\u2019 \u2018this is my spot now\u2019 (when refusing to sit in their assigned spot). Less extreme to be sure, but making the environment more negative. Both had problems doing work in their previous rooms but were far less vocal\u2014obviously they gain more confidence in that respect if others are doing it to.\n\nI really cannot separate these kids more than I am. I speak to these parents frequently (both positive and negative) and nothing seems to change. I know my classroom management isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s also not bad\u2014I got lots of good remarks on it for my evaluation. We have positive reinforcement programs schoolwide that I implement, have consistent consequences and give clear warnings so they know the progression and what\u2019s coming (I.e. losing a dojo point, using some of their recess time to do work that they refused to do in class, etc.). \n\nI usually don\u2019t have a para in the room at all. When I have things have been smoother because it makes a huge difference to have another person there. She has also encouraged me a lot and tells me that I\u2019m doing a great job with the kids and am very calming for them. \n\nBut it\u2019s at the point where I feel like I can\u2019t handle them all myself. Part of the problem I think is that they all came from classrooms that had recess in the morning, and we don\u2019t get ours until the very end of the day. Also just the grouping of these students in one room\u2014they feed off of each other so much. \n\nOther teachers/staff members have started to make comments like \u201cyou really have a lot of those (behaviors) in your room, don\u2019t you?\u201d Or \u201cif I were you I wouldn\u2019t come to work every day.\u201d \n\nEven the principal has come up to me and asked me not to quit numerous times, when I\u2019ve never said anything to suggest that. Not exactly encouraging.\n\nAny advice?",

I emailed the mother and guidance at the beginning of the week, then held the student after class yesterday to talk about it. I was under the impression he was depressed because his parent had told me at the beginning of the year that one of his siblings has been sick and sometimes hospitalized for the past year and it was stressful for the family. He also told my aide that he was tired because his sibling had been hospitalized the night before. During my meeting with the student I brought up the fact that they had a lot going on outside of school, and they never once corrected me. Then I get two emails from the parent. The first is an embarrassed email, because they did not realize their child has been struggling in school. The second does  a CONPLETE 180: I JUST TALKED TO JOHNNY AND HE SAID YOU ONLY GAVE HIM 10 MINUTES TO TAKE TWO TESTS AND THAT YOU BECAME FRUSTRATED WHEN HE DIDNT HAVE HIS LAPTOP AND DIDNT ALLOW HIM TO WORK ON HIS ASSIGNMENT. I have no idea what this kid is taking about. There was one day I asked them to sit in their seat while their laptop charged, then get it when we actually needed it. There was a day the kids had to do an easy two part project and they had an hour and 20 minutes to do it, then were given an extension. I responded that I was flabbergasted and that I had already spoken to him and he was struggling with his mental health and I had given him extensions. The parent responded by saying they had just talked to the kid and they never said they were depressed, that they were distracted from a concussion they had over a year ago. I feel like I'm being gas lit. I have to go to a parent meeting when I get back, and needless to say, this has ruined the start of my break. I don't know how to handle parents and kids like this.

She was nice in the first semester so idk what happened but it just bugs me.",

        "body": "Does anyone else's school district ban Duolingo? I teach high school ESL (English as a Second Language) and have been using Duolingo for a portion of my class since it's so engaging, especially for newcomers. Well...my principal found out that I have been using it and informed me that a member of the school board \"disagreed\" with some of it's content and now it's banned.\n\n I realize that there is that one story that involves homosexuality and I totally understand if some parents don't want their kids exposed to that for whatever reason, but seriously...these are high schoolers and it's still a great language learning program. The thing that annoys me the most is that the school district won't even let me send a permission form home to parents to let them \"opt in or out\" of it AND the school district won't pay for any online language programs or curriculum for that matter...\n\nMaybe it's just my school district or state (AZ) but it's really unfortunate how districts seem to do the absolute bare minimum for EL programs and students.",

        "body": "MEDIA CONTACTS lexingtonbranchnaacp@hotmail.com\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nNAACP President Whit Whitaker released the following statement addressing the Fayette County Public School District\u2019s handling of the Dunbar High School Principal Marlon Ball case:\nLexington-Fayette Branch of the NAACP believes that the community still has unanswered questions about the suspension of Principal Ball\nLexington, KY. \n\nAs reported in November 2022, according to reports, the media announced the death of the Dunbar athletic director stating that according to the Fayette County Coroner, it was being investigated as a suicide. The FCPS District sent an email to parents announcing the death of the Dunbar HS Athletic Director and the media reported on the loss of the athletic director and reported that the Dunbar Principal, Mr. Ball, was being placed on administrative leave by FCPS due to \u201cinappropriate conduct,\u201d which was an unfair action given the history of how other administrative issues have been handled in the past. Exacerbated by online chatter about a statement that the principal made on his personal social media page, a Facebook post that was stated to be about the athletic director in response to his unfortunate death that was never confirmed, nor was there any proof to suggest that the time in which it was posted coincided with the untimely death of the beloved educator, further validated by fellow educators who follow the social media account of Mr. Ball and have stated that the post was made before the principal was notified of Jason Howell\u2019s death; and the post itself made no mention of Mr. Howell nor any mention of suicide, all of which can be researched and validated.\nThere are still lingering questions about the administrative process, policies, and procedures to communicate legitimate staff concerns about this issue and whether or not they were adequately communicated and followed pursuant to the action levied against the Dunbar HS principal; furthermore, this continues to call into question the fairness of the action and the repercussions of the harmful impact on the principal\u2019s career and reputation in the court of public opinion, not only as an African American but also as an educator and administrator, due to misuse and misrepresentation of unsubstantiated statements of misinformation communicated to the media by FCPS staff members based simply on the personal opinions and probable inability to work closely in an environment of conflicting personalities \u2013 essentially labeling the principal as guilty and placing the blame for this unfortunate tragic loss of life squarely and solely on his shoulders.\n\nMr. Ball has never been told what it is that he has been accused of.\n\u2022 alleged that he was aggressively approached by the Chief of Human Resources (Jennifer Dyar) and asked to vacate the building with no apparent explanation as to why he was being asked to leave.\n\n\u2022 has never been allowed to defend himself against the allegations.\n\n\u2022 has been confronted and threatened in the workplace prior to leaving and in public spaces because FCPS and\nits staff have been allowed to control the narrative in the media with the sharing of an unflattering photo that that has some semblance of a mugshot and because of unsubstantiated allegations and statements \n\nIn Comparison and as a Point of Reference:\n\n1. Student who died on the campus of Dunbar in 2017:\n\u2022 Principal (Betsy Rains) was never placed on leave, never investigated, nor was she saddled with blame for the lack of AEDs which could have helped to save the life of the student who is now lost to us.\n\u2022\n\u2022 https://www.lex18.com/news/mother-of-dunbar-high-school-cardiac-arrest-victim-advocates-for-aeds-in- schools?_amp=true\n\u2022 https://gray-arc-content.s3.amazonaws.com/WKYT/Ifeacho%20lawsuit.pd\n\n The Athletic Trainer and other employees responsible for the supervision and care of the student were never placed on leave nor investigated.\n\n    2. Chief of High Schools Employee Compensation incident:\n\u2022 Placed on leave for an employee compensation issue a few days after Mr. Ball was placed on leave.\n\u2022 Investigated and cleared in the middle of December.\n\u2022 Never posted in the articles written about him.\n\u2022 Not demoted or transferred.\n\u2022 Reinstated to the position vacated while on leave.\n\u2022 Allowed to defend himself in the public eye. \n\nChief of Human Resources:\n\n *Placed on leave around the same time.\n Investigated, cleared and reinstated to her same position within a thirty-day window.\n *Picture was never posted in the articles written about her.\n\n *Also allowed to defend herself in the public eye.\n\u2022 https://amp.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article268490717.html\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, statements made about the case involving Mr. Ball and the deceased educator, unsubstantiated statements and allegations made to the media by a Dunbar HS teacher accusing the principal of being a \u201cbully\u201d and \u201charassing\u201d staff members, by speaking to the media about her grievances without first going through the grievance process with Human Resources at Fayette County Public Schools, seem to be a clear violation of the Fayette County Public Schools Employee Code of Conduct. Yet, there was no apparent nor reported disciplinary action taken against the FCPS employee for this apparent violation. Coincidentally, an emergency tip line was also sent to the district office stating that Mr. Ball made a Facebook post in response to the athletic director\u2019s death.\nFinally, if Mr. Ball is guilty, why hasn\u2019t he been criminally prosecuted; if he is not guilty, why hasn\u2019t he been exonerated in the media and by FCPS?\n\nTo be clear, Mr. Ball:\nThere needs to be some transparent and positive resolution in this case. Though this should be about the administrative process, policies, and procedures and the ethical and equitable application across the board for all FCPS District Employees and the ethical enforcement without bias rather than about racial injustice, there seems to be a clear indication that certain individuals are treated differently in comparison when it comes to reprimand and enforcement. As a result of this, the FCPS district\u2019s lack of administrative procedural equity and fairness to provide a safe haven and environment of support for all employees makes them complicit in the destruction and lack of protection and the direct mischaracterization of the character, reputation, and career of Principal Ball. It is unfair to leave Mr. Ball and the community-at-large in the dark with no resolution. Now is the time for answers. Mr. Ball deserves answers.\n\nSincerely,\nWhit Whitaker\nPresident, Lexington-Fayette Branch of the NAACP\nLexington-Fayette Branch 3097 PO Box 13655, Lexington, KY 40583",

        "body": "After 25 years of teaching, I've paid VERY close attention to how sped works (or not).\n\n1. Resource teachers have a caseload of 30 students - even though it's supposed to be a max of 28.\n2. Each kid has an IEP that states something like \"95% in gen ed class, 5% SAE\" which means the kid is pulled for 30 minutes, 3 days a week and may be in a group with 3 others.\n3. Including pick ups, resource teachers meet with kids, usually no more than 4 per group, for about five and a half hours, three days a week - which is completely legit. Resource teachers need a day for testing and a day for IEPs - although it doesn't work out that smoothly. If they try to pack more instruction time in, they will fall behind on the IEPs - and no one wants that.\n4. Instruction time, if grouped well - as it must be- will be 16.5 hrs out of a 35 hr mandated work week (as if). Reg Ed teachers teach sped students for 27.5 hrs per week, plus they have duty times.\n5. Each IEP should take about 3 to 4 hrs to write, so at least 30 to 40 minutes per day (although it's more like 4 hours once per week).\n6. Resource teachers often don't pick up a sped student, or push in, or whatever, because they are so backed up on IEPs and testing. Reg ed teachers understand - but they don't have that kind of flexibility.\n7. Here's the thing: Reg Ed teachers have four sped students 95% of the day, five days a week. They also have a couple of 504 students, and a couple of disabled students that have yet to be evaluated- or whose parents refuse to have the child evaluated. That's a lot of accommodation on the fly! In fact - it's waaayyy too much. A ridiculous amount. **It's a set up to fail. And a giant liability factor.**\n8. Even though our sped system doesn't work (see ANY state test scores or see ANY [yearly OSEP report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/osep/index.html)) reg ed teachers rely on and generally appreciate Resource Teachers. We couldn't do it without you.\n\nAnyway you dice it, **Reg Ed Teachers are the foremost sped teachers - trained or not (not) -and it's damn time everyone came to understand that's how it is and gave them the proper support to succeed.**",

I don\u2019t want to falsely accuse anyone of anything, especially someone I have to share my room with for 2 more months, but this isn\u2019t the first time a sub has stolen from us.

I was completely blindsided by this, as my evaluations have been pretty normal and I wasn't aware of anything wrong with my practice or anything else. I asked for more details, and my principal said he couldn't say anything else other than I wasn't a good fit for the school and for the direction he wanted to take things. \n\nI talked to my union rep and he told me that they likely can't do anything because I'm still probationary.\n\nI'm in complete shock. I'm not sure what I should do or what I need, other than I need to get this off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "body": "I am a freshman adolescent education (social studies) major and because of that, I follow some teachers on TikTok and am on TeacherTok.\n\nOne of the creators I followed recently made a video addressing schools going paperless, including elementary schools and how young kids are now having even more time in front of a screen, both in school and at home.\n\nWhile I am 18, Chromebooks didn't become a major thing in my district until COVID, and Google Classroom was only created when I was about to enter 5th grade. My question is: are elementary schools using Chromebooks and for the elementary teachers, how much of the day do you use them? Is it more than you would like? Is your district pushing paperless and if it is, has that caused a reliance on Chromebooks for the youngest students? How do you think this will affect children's brains/psychology?",

I\u2019m kind of confused- what would that really do for her? Can she sue us for being on the chromebook \u201ctoo much\u201d even though her son is bypassing GoGuardian and disobeying by avoiding the tasks I assign and going on a different site? \n\nMy classroom policy is if I catch them on websites they shouldn\u2019t be they have to put their chromebook away and do grammar sheets instead and have no free time Fridays. This works most of the time, but her child probably doesn\u2019t get screen time and home and tries their hardest to sneak around.

I am consistently addressing the small areas of concern, such as pacing. Admins had even tasked me this year with being the head of two grade levels and mentoring newer teachers. The only reason my closest coworkers and I can think of is maybe budgetary cuts, because our numbers are significantly lower compared to pre-COVID.\n\nI really loved it at my site and felt so supported, and I was here for three years. Now I'm worried this will affect my future employment if they see that I wasn't re-elected. \n\nI do have a union, but my union rep is not the most helpful person unfortunately. I asked him what I can do to leave on good terms, logistical details about when my benefits expire, etc. But he ends up re-centering the conversation on how he was re-elected after his second year in this district despite having bad evals as a way of saying \"Anything can happen when you're not tenured!\" I really just want concise and accurate information on my next steps.",

Also, I didn\u2019t find his personal email. He is now the principal of the school I went to, and his email was on their homepage.

Admin offer zero support on behaviors, and trying to implement any form of classroom expectations is thwarted by admin every time.  My blessing and curse, however, is that the school literally gives zero fucks about my subject.  That means I receive no support whatsoever, however, they also don't care and never check in unless it's the rare occasion they need to do an observation (maybe 3 times a year).\n\nI've realized that regardless of what I do, the same students do their assignments, while the rest do literally nothing, but they're all addicted to their phones and don't want to participate regardless.  Group work?  They literally refuse.  Answering questions aloud during the lesson?  Maybe one child per class.  It doesn't matter how I teach it or what I do, the lessons end with the same outcome: I have the same handful of students who always submit assignments, and then the rest do literally nothing, but while I am teaching they're all on their phones, literal zombies.  \n\nI've just started assigning my classes stuff to do on their own while I sit around at my desk.  The same outcome occurs, with a few kids doing their work, and the rest playing on their phones.  I feel like I'm becoming a shitty teacher, essentially a babysitter, and feel that I'm letting these kids down sometimes.  I don't even do stuff during my planning, I just slap an old lesson down from last year on the board and call it a day while the students do individual work on their own.  I'm planning on changing schools and grade levels next year, but my stress levels have plummeted since I stopped caring.  I still hate this, but it's practically a survival strategy at this point.  Can't go home upset and disappointed if I have zero expectations for them to disappoint in the first place.\n\nAm I shitty for doing this?  Can anyone else relate?  Perhaps the extreme apathy of the students is rubbing off on me.",

I won't even explain the situation, as I hope it is evident in the e-mail: the parent believes I am not \"teaching\" her son.\n\nHere is my e-mail back that I will schedule-send for Tuesday morning. Thoughts? \n\n    Hi, [mom]!\n    \n    Good to hear from you, and I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I am sure [student] appreciated the day off yesterday! \n    \n    I have [student] in two classes, and - I must be honest - this is shocking for me to hear. Can you be more specific? As noted in the syllabus (in both classes), and continually in class, computer science is a student-led endeavor: I give students projects that utilize their creativity and call them to build their own projects. I teach a few fundamental ideas, and students run wild with their own ideas. Following this, I am available - in class, during office hours, and even before school - for individual help. As a teacher of nearly 10 years, I have found this to be significantly more effective (and fun) than the typical lecture-notes-homework-project structure. More importantly, this leads to real learning, the type of learning that is ingrained because they aren't merely copying me, but problem-solving themselves. The trade-off is that I do not have have the typical \"watch me do this and regurgitate yourself\" style content, and most students - especially underclassmen - are thrown off by this. \n    \n    I suppose what is so shocking to me is that this is the first time hearing that [student] is having difficulties. \n    \n    I hope that clears it up, and I am more than happy to answer more questions. Much more importantly, though, is that I hope he feels comfortable to ask me. \n    \n    Thank you!",

        "body": "It would also essentially require schools to act as rehab facilities. I'm curious what others think. It seems like another feel-good proposal that will be poorly planned/implemented, like restorative justice and trauma informed pedagogy. I actually think the latter two are great in theory, but I've seen them horribly misapplied, such that students basically know they never face real consequences for garbage behavior. I personally think students who bring drugs onto campus are a danger to other students, and if we really care about them, then we would create a special school within the district with focused, wraparound services that they can go to until they are ready to return to their regular school. Instead, schools would likely just half-ass it due to poor training, poor staffing, and regular staffing turnover.\n\nI would appreciate other people's ideas, as I tend to be a little more conservative after working in education for 15 years and watching similar initiatives create awful results. https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20232024/AB599/",

I don\u2019t have a classroom, it\u2019s a small private school, so I don\u2019t make very much, I actually make below the state minimum for teachers. I don\u2019t have a lot of support from admin when it comes to behavior, and I\u2019m feeling very burnt out overall. I started looking around at public school jobs this week and put in a few applications. \n\nI heard back from school today and the benefits are amazing. I would make above the state minimum for teachers, I would finally have my own classroom, the school has a very strict plan for dealing with behavioral issues, there\u2019s supplemental pay, and I\u2019d also be running a program closer to what I would be looking to run long-term. However, when I applied my thought was that they were hiring for the beginning of next year, but it turns out they are looking to hire immediately. \n\nI would feel absolutely terrible leaving the school that I am in now in the middle of the year. However, as it stands, I have to work three jobs to pay my bills, and I don\u2019t have very much left by the end of it all. I can\u2019t decide what to do.

I\u2019ve had to work 2 to 3 jobs for several years now and at the public school I could finally work just one job and still have plenty to pay my bills and then some. Do any teachers on here have any advice? My interview is on Monday so I have some time to mull it over and I\u2019m going to see, if the school would be opposed to allowing me to start next year, however, if they aren\u2019t OK with that, I need to decide whether or not I\u2019m going to take the jump or not.

        "body": "And do students these days have the attention span to watch a movie in its entirety that a teacher shows? Or do you find that behavioral issues always arise when showing a full length movie in its entirety (talking, phone usage, sleeping, horseplay)?\n\nMore than anything, movies were what humanized history and made it come to life for me. How can it be frowned upon to show entire movies if one of the reasons I got into history is because of movies?\n\nBackstory:\nI recall reminiscing nostalgically to an older colleague as a naive first year teacher about how my World History high school teacher in the 2004-2005 school year showed the entire 2 hour 30 minute long 1979 remake of All Quiet on the Western Front starring Richard Thomas. I talked about how interesting this was and especially about how I\u2019d like to pass the  experience down to my own students. My high school World History teacher showed the movie over the course of four 45 minute class periods.  Everyone watched the movie quietly and respectfully. No one talked and there was no cellphone usage. However, to my dismay and eternal disillusionment, my colleague\u2019s response to all this was \u201coh man\u2026 attention spans have declined so much in the last 15 years since then, students today won\u2019t be able to sit through that. Engaging lessons these days need to be like a TiKTok feed . Boom, boom,  boom, with different flavored fireworks every 15 minutes \u2026\u201d \n\nOddly it\u2019s also frowned upon to show entire movies at the campus I work at despite my own mid to late 2000\u2019s high school experience during which countless movies were shown to me in their entirety. The school I work at has 1 hour 30 min periods versus the high school I went to as a kid that had 45 min periods.  So you would think the 1 hour 30 minute periods would be more compatible for showing movies. I also recall me and my peers being super excited to see any movie the teacher would show too. I remember the talkative and the not-so-shy students vocalizing with giddy excitement \u201ccan we watch a movie please\u2026..!\u201d repeatedly to the teacher. \n\nThe idea that\u2019s been put into my head that students these days can\u2019t appreciate a full length movie in their entirety greatly saddens and disillusions me",

I'm in my last year of university, doing a degree in criminology (in Mexico), I'm doing an investigation on forensic crime scene investigators, and how the acquisition of knowledge can facilitate or lead them to commit a crime. I'm focusing on the prevention side of things from an institute of higher education standpoint, so prevention starting from universities. After investigating for the past 2 months or so, professionals that have committed crimes in this line of work (ruling out mental health issues) seems to lack professional ethics, responsibility, and commitment (responsibility and commitment regarding their profession and to society). So, I took a look at the study plan for all grades and courses of the degree at the university I'm at, and there's only one subject relating to professional ethics for the whole 3 years. So, the idea here is so instill these teachings at this stage of their professional formation, but how? As educators, what would be the methods, study plans or strategies you would use? And if there is some article or study on the matter that would help too as I have not found any.",

        "body": "So a parent sent me a long email today, requesting a parent teacher conference with admin present. They claimed that her child had submitted work from when they were absent, but I never graded it. The parent called me irresponsible, continued to say that I've been treating their child poorly and unfairly, and mentioned that the child didn't want the email to be sent because they didn't want to be ostracized.\n\nThe student got a C and a B in previous quarters... I double checked the grade book, but everything that was submitted was graded. There were several missing assignments.\n\nIf the student emailed me work, which I regularly tell students not to do, as it can get missed, I still would have graded it. If I ever mark anything late or missing, students can very easily ask me to correct it, and I do. The student always comes to me to ask about make-up work when they're absent, which I explain. But I have never had the student OR the parent reach out with any concerns...until now. \n\nI'm frustrated because of how aggressive the email was, and the fact that I like the kid. But I'm also worried that maybe the kid sent me work and I genuinely missed it... I haven't responded to the parent yet because I'm waiting to talk to admin/guidance, but what should I do in this situation?",

        "body": "I've been teaching for a bit and have noticed an increase in anxiety and depression at the school I work at. I wanted to run a questionnaire at the school to explore possible factors that might be influencing student mental health. I created the following questionnaire for that:\n\n [ https://forms.gle/KU1vQ6Wak7Xa4dwq7](https://forms.gle/KU1vQ6Wak7Xa4dwq7)  \n\nI was wondering if I could get advice from some other professionals? Should I change the wording of anything, reduce questions/remove entirely? Also if anyone has advice for how to run it safely at school (restrictions to use of information/restrictions to distributing it etc.) that would be appreciated. I know there have got to be some legal restrictions especially when working with minors but last time I did any study was during student teaching and the college helped us get all the legal forms and restrictions in order. This also deals with a pretty heavy and hard topic (as well as being a mandated reporter - I'm not sure what types of problems I might encounter)\n\nI would also note I don't intend to write an article or public research of any sort. The most I would want would be to share with my colleagues/admins so that they can be aware of what's happening at the school. \n\nIt's fine if you come back with an absolute don't do this - it's why I'm asking peers first. So that I can avoid anything stupid.\n\nNote - yes, this is a throwaway account. Since I was wanting to give this at my school, I didn't want students possibly being able to trace this back to my main account.",

I think we can all agree on that. But if we just think about that a little deeper: of course we all learn at different speeds and in different ways...so why not just take differentiation to its  logical conclusion: individualization. Differentiation is like a half ass version of individualization. It's like everywhere here in this classroom learns differently but I'll provide you with three different options. Those three options may not work for you given that everyone learns in their own unique way. But we've chose differentiation, the lazy way of doing individualization. Why can't teachers just embrace individualized instruction?",

Ranging from \"angry at every student for everything / generally hates children\" to \"low energy, apathetic, can't be bothered to actually teach.\" People will create excuses for them, but if teaching has sucked the life out of you and turned you into a jerk, then it's time to quit. Not stick around and make school miserable for kids who haven't done anything to you.\n\n\u200bThere are tons of bigoted teachers too, and some who absolutely play favorites in bullying situations. \n\nWhen it comes to the American education system, I believe all parties (admin, teachers, parents, and students) are at fault and have contributed to the poor state that it's in.

Since I already passed their level of classes and I have a short holiday, I want to help them in whatever way possible but am not sure how I would teach them in a way where I can see them write alongside me and solve together.  \n\n\nThe only method I found but is tiring, is VR and using pens in a game called VRChat. However, this's not ideal nor effective for large amount of revision due to finite battery life of the VR headsets.  \nThank you for reading.",

        "title": "Bullied out of teaching",
        "body": "I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m so fucking angry. \n\nContext: I moved school districts to be closer to my family before making a big move this upcoming summer. 3 years of teaching under my belt, I felt ready for the transition from teaching 7th grade to teaching HS in a rural community. I knew it would be a complete change of pace, but I\u2019m determined to make a difference in students lives. I pride myself on creating an inclusive space for ALL students and I don\u2019t care about your athleticism or your last name. You will be treated fairly in my classroom. \n\nNote: This includes classroom decor. Big sore spot for the \u201cconservative\u201d students seeing a 4\u201dx6\u201d rainbow flag behind my desk on a filing cabinet. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI started the school year fine, but quickly the entire class of juniors became a problem group for me. Insanely disrespectful and hateful and mean to each other. The good students beaten into submission to not speak up or against their peers who acted out. \n\nAs the @ndrew Hate pandemic swept adolescent boys throughout the world this year, so did his work grace the interiors of my classroom. I was mindful about my responses and told students that I just didn\u2019t think he was a good role model and I didn\u2019t really want to talk about him in my class. My juniors pushed this boundary relentlessly.\n\nAfter taking a Friday off for a concert, I came back on a Monday to pictures of the pos taped ALL over my classroom. I didn\u2019t want to let the juniors get to me, so I took them down and said nothing about it. \n\nThe school year continued with defiance, refusal to do work, nasty attitudes, bullying, vandalism of fidgets and comfort items in my room, and little to no support from admin to resolve any of the issues I\u2019d been facing. \n\nConferences came around and despite having some awesome conversations with parents about their students, 3 sets of parents came to yell at me, with one interaction being bad enough that I had to get the principal to sit in on the conference. Bet you can\u2019t guess which class their kids were in\u2026 Accusations that I treated their kids unfairly and targeted and bullying them were the running theme of these conversations. My rainbow decor \u201cpushed an agenda\u201d and I \u201cgraded unfairly due to political stances.\u201d Neither of which were true, I was just responsible for trying to be inclusive and I didn\u2019t care how prestigious their family was in the community. If their child wrote a bad paper, their child wrote a bad paper. In my last confrontation, the parents hadn\u2019t even read their child\u2019s paper, and after showing them that it wasn\u2019t the best written, the dad entirely changed his attitude\u2026 hm\u2026 crazy.\n\nJust a week after that, I had to take an unexpected sick day. Came back to my room covered again in @ndrew Hate\u2019s face. \n\nI bullied and harassed their kids? I can\u2019t even leave my room for ONE day without a s*x trafficker being plastered all over my walls, ceiling, belongings, and even inside my desk. \n\nTo wrap this up, I had an emotional breakdown. Just 2 months of being harassed and treated like crap for wanting my classroom to be a comfortable space for all students. I quit. I had to leave. I\u2019m going through therapy, even discussing ptsd about this situation (idek if I want to teach at all after this). I\u2019ve been doing my best to move past what happened and hope for a better future with my specific skill set and abilities. \n\nMy anger is with that school system failing me. No one helped me. And to add the cherry on top, another teacher that was hired this year has been drinking and smoking with students, and has been caught more than once with HS students at his house after school. No one in my community is bringing this up or making anything of it. I\u2019m this evil liberal feminist teacher indoctrinating their sweet babies with a rainbow flag and asking my students not to use the n word, but this potential predator gets to hide under the radar. \n\nIt\u2019s bullshit and I\u2019m angry.",

I teach virtually, and occasionally a student\u2019s parent may attend the live class and observe. I have no problems with them observing. I had an unsettling situation recently where a student\u2019s parent attended the live class. Immediately upon the class ending, he called me. I was in the middle of something so let my voicemail get it. He didn\u2019t leave a message, but then emailed me asking for a call back. I called him back a few minutes later and he asked me if I always do my classes \u201clike that\u201d. I asked what he meant and he said that I was talking about things parents teach their kids and he didn\u2019t know how it related to healthcare. (The current unit I am covering is safety. It goes over a wide range of safety info, such as fire safety, natural disaster safety, active shooter safety, OSHA regulations, needle use safety etc.) So I explained how safety pertains to the healthcare field. Then he asked about two short videos that I showed, one about natural disasters that I had a Microsoft form for the students to fill out while watching, and one about traumatic brain injuries. He asked why I showed those particular videos. I again explained the reasoning based on the content we are covering. Then he said, I see how long you\u2019ve been a __________. (My industry profession). Then he said I\u2019ve been a _____________ for over twenty years. I assumed he had looked up my licenses and certifications on the state website. Later that evening, I got on LinkedIn and saw that he had actually been viewing my LinkedIn profile and that is how he knew how long I had been in the profession. I felt kind of violated, knowing that he searched me out all within a couple minutes of the class ending. I mentioned this to some of my coworkers and they assured me that I wasn\u2019t being dramatic or overreacting. I mentioned this to admin and they had no response. So I am just asking is this common for a student\u2019s parent to google search you and look at your social media? Has this happened to anyone else?",

They refuse to work, take accountability for their actions, and are obsessed with social media. Students get angry when things are hard and can't understand how they are failing even though they are doing nothing after getting so much \"grace\" during Covid. They are mean to each other. I'm constantly asking why they want friends that treat them so poorly. Violence and property destruction have increased. More kids are suicidal. More are turning to drugs and alcohol, reversing the downward trend over recent years.  \n\nAs hard as this is now, what does this look like when they go out to college and work and things are harder, the grace is gone, and real world consequences catch up? I honestly thought about moving up to teach at a college, but a real fear of increased on campus violence has me rethinking this. Is this what we are setting up? More frustrated students that think violence will solve their problems?  The amount of gun violence is heartbreaking and disturbing now, but what happens when we release more kids that cannot cope with the struggle, disappointment, and failure in the world? Maybe my anxiety has peaked, but I'm really scared about what the next decade will bring.",

Constant disruptions, cussing across the room, starting small, stupid, punitive arguments with each other. Shoving each other in their desks. Touching each others Chromebooks and pencils and papers and ALL THE THINGS. \n\nSo I gave up. I sat down. And I told myself that if admin came through the door to do an observation, which would be absolutely typical on a shit day like this, I would tell them that these children are unteachable, that my 6 years of polished classroom management techniques and other professional tactics don\u2019t work on them. That these 15 kids are single handedly driving me out of this profession and maybe you, oh so wise admin who sit/ perched up in your office 24/7, can teach these unteachable kids. Because I\u2019m done trying.\n\nThis profession was my dream, and it\u2019s failed me.

We can't go back to the pre-IDEA era where special ed students were completely segregated from other schoolchildren and forced to go to special schools where they were often treated like insane asylum patients because nobody wanted to deal with them, and suffered severe academic and social consequences by not being allowed to engage with peers different from them. \n\nAt the same time, I feel like disabilities at times aren't an excuse for poor behavior or lack of effort in academics, and that sometimes, unfortunately, integration and inclusivity *doesn't* work for specific students with severe disabilities or those whose behavior could seriously threaten the health and safety of themselves, and others. The harsh truth is that some students cannot and should not be integrated or mainstreamed, and this may be a bitter pill to swallow for some parents or for society, who want to believe that any child can succeed no matter what. Conversely, some kids who have IEPs or 504 plans are actively being harmed by such plans since they don't need them in the first place, but have the plans because parents want their child to get special treatment or have it easy. \n\nParents need to do a better job of disciplining their children at home instead of having teachers/the state do all the heavy lifting, then blaming *us* when things don't go as planned. How is it Ms. Zwerner's fault that a 6 year old child brought a gun to school and nearly killed her, when she was doing her job and alerting the moronic admins about the child's escalating conduct? \n\nThe more I think about it, the more it seems like we can't have it both ways. We can't integrate every special ed kid in the classroom because that just leads to more classroom management issues and more headaches for already overworked, stressed teachers, many of whom are not qualified to teach special ed students and are not being helped due to the massive shortage of special ed professionals, but we can't just shove them in a box and pretend like they don't exist either.",

I can see where things can be better and I just keep telling myself that will improve next year or with experience or even the next time we do it. I want people to like me. I feel so defeated.",

I understand and admire her not wanting to rat her friend out.

She is an A student and hasn't shown to me any behavioral problems. \n\nNot sure if I should show this to the class and address it... or deal out a punishment to the student who's account was used to write it. The dean told me that there has to be something done punishment wise and my fellow teachers said that I need to find out who wrote it. \n\nI'm really not sure what to do. There isn't really electronic signatures with this kind of thing and I don't have leads to go off by.

The student works exeptionally hard in my math class, but never seems to use the right tools on the right problems and ends up getting 30's on tests on their first attempt, and 70's on their second attempt as I allow retakes.\n\nStudent tends to work on homework for 2-3 hrs a night in spite of me asking them not to multiple times, and asking their parents to not let them work on it for more than 20 min. I've also had student come in 2x a week for extra practice after school, but they never ask questions and keep mixing up what thing to do when.\n\nSo when I was asked how well the student would do in another teacher's room I was honest in my response stating that their test scores are consistent across every kind of test we've done and the student always falls in the same place on the normalized distribution curve. I didnt think a change in teacher would make a difference.\n\nI'd been asking since the beginning of the year for the student to not spend 2-3 hrs on the work as that builds anxiety and animosity towards the subject, which creates a learning block that is incredibly difficult to overcome. I've also stated the student can always ask q's before class, after class, during study halls, and during after school tutoring, but they never do.\n\nSo my questions:\n\nWas being honest like that the right thing to do?\n\n How could I have been more tactful? \n\nAnd do you have any tactics/tricks/ideas that'd help this student?",

I think she was hurt that I had pulled back from that. \n\nMom came in and I know I was a lot more defensive than I should have been. I just honestly could not move past it. I gave her a copy of the grade printout with all the missing assignments and assured her that they could still be turned in and the quizzes could all be retaken. Also that her child was well aware of this.\n\nShe then backpedaled. Hard. She went on about she had always appreciated everything I had done for her kids and something, something, something. It felt hollow and I think she could tell I didn't really believe her. \n\nI've calmed down but there is still that little bit that needles at me. We are on a trimester schedule, so today was the last day with this student. I'm not upset with her and do still like her, but I think it is a good thing I won't have her for the rest of the year.",

I've looked for the past week at tons of places and I don't care too much about union/non-union (union is preferred though) and I want to be at least near a major-ish city (200,000 or higher if possible). I assume Kentucky is not a good state to teach in and was looking at some other options, especially for the future since I won't graduate for 2 years and I didn't know if certain states had more openings.\n\nI was specifically looking at Columbus, Washington State, Portland, Raleigh, or Minneapolis. I had heard all around that Washington state is very good but I didn't know if there would be high competition because of that. If anyone has any insight or tips for where I should go to start and continue my career, that would be very much appreciated. I can teach in Kentucky for a year or two and decide while I stay with family to save some money but I wanted to see about moving once I graduate. Also, I don't see many positions available right now. I assume they open in April/May, is that correct?

I\u2019m not excusing if kids are taking home items they are not\u2026. But you do the activity &amp; they put the items away- how does an approximately show box size box of these little bundles of erasers suddenly turn up 95 % empty? \n\nThoughts ? AITA?",

        "title": "Pros and cons of teaching high school? Is going for a Master's in Special Ed worth it?",
        "body": "1. Regarding my first question, I'm curious to know what, in your experience, the pros and cons of teaching high school might be. I ask because I currently teach middle school but want to eventually transition to high school teaching. Problem is that I've received mixed opinions from colleagues: some teachers I've talked to say it is so much better than middle school, but my mentor said, at least in my district, that the high school is harder and worse because of issues like delinquency and disrespect among really tall HS students who  think they're adults, and subpar management. \n\nOff the top of my head, I'm inclined that teaching high school is better than middle school because I have to (presumably, I would hope) deal with less immaturity and behavior problems from students, and HS teacher salaries are somewhat higher than salaries for lower grades. I also would have little issue teaching more complex material, although I have heard it can be difficult for people just starting out (and that includes me--I'm still relatively new). \n\n2. Regarding my second question, I'm deeply conflicted over whether I should go for my Master's in Special Ed, since I just started the alternate route program at my school and still have to take 350 hours worth of courses at my college to receive my Standard Certificate. \n\nPart of me doesn't want to take the leap because I'm already in debt from undergrad and don't see a positive ROI for a Master's considering I will most likely have to pay out of pocket or take out loans to afford the education, for only a modest jump in my salary (i.e. I will be spending more $$$ than I know I will receive). And even though Special Ed teaching is in high demand, I don't think I can teach special ed students for more than a few years because I know the stress, additional workload, low pay, and crappy students will eventually drive me insane. It just doesn't seem worth the effort, especially when many SPED kids won't make it no matter how hard you try to help them. \n\nAnd seeing other professionals make 80-100K right out the gate just makes me feel worse. I am *not* waiting 20 years in my district to make what friends of mine will be almost certainly be making in 5 as businessmen, lawyers, doctors, engineers, etc!!!\n\nBut I don't really have a choice anymore because I've already committed myself a year into my Provisional Teacher Program. I don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time like I kind of did at the end of undergrad, but I also don't want to stay stagnant in the same teaching position forever, or commit to a path I may later come to regret. I feel trapped and locked in, all because I took a massive gamble by being an imbecile and going to art school with the expectation I would get a job in the fields I studied/did internships in, only for nothing to materialize. \n\nAdvice would be much appreciated in these trying times for me. Thank you!",

I\u2019ve taught at a title one school where there was no parent involvement to a school where there is a lot of parent involvement. I\u2019m fairly young and I look it. I probably act it a bit too. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an insecurity, but I think this gets me into more trouble and reduces the authority I have with the kids and with parents\u2014to some extent. \n\nSo far in my career I\u2019ve had two really bad encounters with parents. Where they\u2019ve basically told me I shouldn\u2019t be in the profession because of what I\u2019ve said to their kids. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said anything egregious. I have great relationships with some of the students, but there always seems to be a few that just absolutely hate me. Even if I get good ratings or have good kids that I\u2019ve made a great impression on, I\u2019m really bothered by these two incidents. I also feel like they were a bit unjust. I always perceived it as I did something every other teacher would get away with saying, but because it\u2019s me, I have it turn into a big deal. Like the teacher next door could say the same thing and the kid would shut up and move on, but kids feel like they can get me because of how I am perceived. \n\nBoth of my bad incidents were resolved once the parents just absolutely laid into me, and never turned into anything more than a parent teacher conference, but they said things that have altered my confidence with my interactions. \n\nAs long as I feel like I did the right thing, or handled a situation the right way, I try not to let it bother me. But now I have huge anxiety about getting emails from parents. I\u2019ve taken my email off my phone because I can\u2019t handle it if I get something from a parent and can\u2019t immediately address it and resolve the issue. But I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t shake it. I\u2019m not doing, and would never do, anything to purposefully hurt students or hurt their feelings or whatever, but I am so terrified of parental backlash. A student gets mad at me for something, and the parent is always right (according to leadership anyway)\n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for some tips on how I can move forward. Any management tips in the classroom to avoid these kinds of incidents, coping strategies, or just words of wisdom.",

The Board agreed, so I agreed to do the first book only, and I included other upper grade students. I planned a popcorn and Hunger Games movie party for the end of the unit. All parents signed a District p-slip.\n\nBut mom became very agitated when the party day loomed. She accused me of poor judgement because, according to her, the star of the series was immoral. She had proof! She was livid that I held the party without her kids (her choice). According to my principal, she reported to the superintendent that I exposed the other students to a porn star. I had no idea!\n\nI went to the Twitterverse to ask about it, and my timeline was flooded with free-access videos of this wonderful actress completely naked at parties, and willing to do anything. Every single video was clearly labeled \"Deep Fake,\" - a fact that her 12th grade son failed to mention after he accidentally stumbled across every single one of them on her phone.\n\nOur society does not value teachers. I know! I know - I will receive replies from far more 'dedicated' teachers than me, chiding me for such a blanket statement. I was a teacher for 25 years in a district with mostly nice kids, parents and site staff. It was the top level administrators who dragged us down. In today's world of teaching, three out of four is as good as it gets. But instead of going another five years as I'd planned, I finally saw the blinking neon warnings and got the hell out.\n\nTeaching used to be great! - but ever since the age of cell phones, social media, and guns; teaching is too dangerous - both physically and mentally.",

I understand that obviously we shouldn't be mean to our students, but this PD rubbed me the wrong way. I am a fairly new teacher, and I was extremely empathetic when I started. I responded to everything with kindness and understanding and support. But all that lead to was them taking advantage of me and my kindness. I'm now still empathetic as a default, but as soon as they are straight up rude or unreasonable, I'm not going to put up with it. You can only give them so many chances. I know that they're kids, but why does that mean we are essentially excusing their behavior for the sake of \"building relationships\". Quite frankly I don't want to build relationships with people who treat me like dirt. I will be polite to them, offer my help, etc, but I will not let them think their behavior is okay again and again. It's a toxic relationship. Letting my students use me as a doormat would make my classroom management worse, not better. It shouldn't be my job to be their therapist and analyze their past trauma to help them learn better. I'm sorry but I literally don't have time to do that for 100+ kids. It also shouldn't be my job to re-parent them and fill in the gaps that are very clearly missing in many of them. I didn't sign up for that. I'm sorry if this comes off too harsh but I'm just so done with pretending that it's okay to be treated so terribly day in and day out as a normal part of our job, respond with empathy, and move on (until of course it happens again 5 minutes later).",

I also realized that I really HAD messed up, I had gotten some criticism that I'd given too much away on my last study guides, so I overcorrected and didn't give enough on the next study guides, the questions were too difficult...\n\nBasically I really HAD given at least a kind of unfair test, so the weekend after grades and report cards came out I suggested to my principal that the 7th grade (and ONLY 7th grade) write an essay worth ten points to make some points back.\n\nI get an email back saying I waited too long, should have asked before the grades came out, now I'm stuck deal with it.\n\nCue multiple absolutely livid parents later, angry meetings, and me having no ammo and no clue what to say, and the principal calls me in, tells me I messed up, so now ALL THREE MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADES are going to spend the whole week doing a new project that will REPLACE their midterms unless they got an A.\n\nAll week I am hyper-monitored by the principal; at one point I got in trouble because, even though I addressed it immediately, I let one student bother another. I was told \"\\[coworker\\] will contact the parents but now this is going to be a massive problem and it should be you dealing with this\" (???? I never asked co-worker to do anything, I'd have done it, but apparently I am just no longer trusted.\n\nAnd to top it off, assessments were due to be handed in to my principal this week, which I completely forgot because I spent the entire week on these stupid midterm projects that if it were up to me I would not have done. So that speech is coming too.\n\nWhat's really got me here is that this isn't even a bad environment. Helpful coworkers, good area, admin for whatever my gripes is supportive, and I feel like I'm just doing a terrible job anyway.\n\nI give. I'm done. I admit it. I'm not good at this. But here I am. I need to figure this shit out now.",

I  worked for a tech company, dabbled with technical writing, and at the end of it all, felt bored to tears\u2026 and HEARTBROKEN that the thing I wanted to do most, teach, was so awful! \n\nFast-forward to now\u2026 I work at my old high school, am surrounded by exceptional coworkers, and am having an amazing time at PTC. The class officers are bringing snacks, soda, etc. and every parent I\u2019ve interacted with has been so supportive. \n\nIt seems like I\u2019m an outlier, but to anyone lurking on this sub who is convinced that teaching is ALWAYS awful, keep looking. It\u2019s easier said than done, and maybe I\u2019m just lucky, but I truly do love my job.\n\nDo I love when 17-year-olds make disgusting comments? No.\n\nDo I love when I encounter sophomores who can\u2019t spell to save their lives? No. \n\nDo I love when parents (who are ADMINS!!!) come to the school to kick and scream because their idiot spawn has no motivation at all? No!\n\nBut I love being in a community that I connect with. There\u2019s no weakness in admitting that you\u2019re not fit for a Title 1 school, or even a school that\u2019s affluent, but made up of monsters.\n\nFind your people. Find your community. And come to SLC because there\u2019s a lot of structure here that contrasts so heavily with the horror stories I read on this sub everyday. \n\nJust my two cents. I hope this doesn\u2019t come off as naive. I\u2019m just happy I can be in this career and not want to jump off a bridge",

They interrupt me while I\u2019m trying to explain something or helping another student, they stand up, walk around, talk back, throw things\u2026\nIn the beginning of the week, I thought they were like that due to the fact they had multiple supplies during the last week, so they thought I would be there for a day or two. They were testing me all the time, but I controle the classes. However, I had to send one to the office on Monday, one today and two tomorrow (due to misbehave by the end of the class). I also kept a group of boys with me during recess yesterday, but today they misbehaved again. \n\nDue to the sick leave, the teacher didn\u2019t give much to work with the class, so they spend a lot of time using their Chromebook, which I have zero control of. So I decided to search some extra activities to keep them busy, but nothing really works with those specific boys. \n\nToday another teacher had to come to my class because she heard me shouting at one boy. I told him to stay in class so I would have a convo with him. I was standing by the door, blocking it and he simply walked away and shouted at me!!!! I couldn\u2019t control myself anymore!!!!\n\nPlease, send me ideas for class management, activities as learning moments, or even \u201cpunishment\u201d. I still have another 3 weeks with them and I must be able to teach them the content without kissing my mind. \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f",

        "body": "Sorry for the uninformative title, but it\u2019s hard to unpack this in just the title. \n\nI\u2019m currently a Junior in High School. When I was a freshman, I had a teacher who I will now call Mr. K. Mr. K was the type to to make fun of students. He did not do it in a malignant way, but it could hurt and he would not care if it did. I personally never had too much of a problem with him because I was usually a good student and have thick skin. I got a B+ in his class and then generally forgot about my issues with him because, though that class was mandatory, He didn\u2019t teach any other required class, only an AP class in the same area. I\u2019m going to take that class next year, but there are other teachers and it isn\u2019t really relevant.\n\nI never really liked Mr. K, but I didn\u2019t care too much. Not all teachers are gonna be great for me, right? This year, one of my friends, who I\u2019ll call Joseph, has him. I met Joseph through an extracurricular, as he is a freshman this year. He is consistently picked on, not like attacked or anything, but all the other guys are assholes to him (to be honest that whole grade is awful, but I digress). Joseph has heavy ADHD. He accommodations for this, as due to his ADHD he is very disorganized, to the point where it\u2019s a problem. He is supposed to be given prewritten notes for the class for a reason that I am not entirely clear on, but (just be clear) I fully support. He has this because he needs it. I know another person who has the same accommodations and it has **never** been a problem for her to my knowledge. Mr. K straight up refuses to do this. He will not make or give these notes.\n\nIt should be noted that Joseph is actually really good at this class. Though he has Cs (and a few Bs) in most of his classes, he is apparently doing really well in this specific class. Except he\u2019s not, due to one assignment. It\u2019s a very writing heavy assignment. For those of you who know what it is, it\u2019s Cornell Notes. They take forever, especially if you, like Joseph and, to a lesser degree, myself, have a short attention span. They are due as part of a binder check before every test. For a reason that I cannot remember, Joseph was not able to have them done by class. If I remember correctly, he just left them at home, though it\u2019s also possible he just wasn\u2019t able to do them. Mr. K, in the only helpful thing he\u2019s ever done, said he could turn them in the next morning before school. Great, right? Except Joseph is a Freshman, and can\u2019t drive himself. Something happens outside of his control (I think it involved his younger siblings) and he arrives to school two classes into the day. After Mr. K\u2019s class. Mr. K refuses to let him turn it in. \n\nOkay, sorry for the rant. I\u2019m rather upset about this. A lot of my friends are neurodivergent and I may be as well, so this makes me angry. The second one is admittedly just a complaint and not any actual rule break, but I would like to know if anyone has an opinion on this. \n\nThank you for reading.",

        "body": "So our school had spirit week this week. One of the dress up days was decade's day. There was a contest, and they were judging the high school kids. All of a sudden, there was a black student and a white student who decided to chase each other around during assembly. The crazy part was that the white student was chasing the black student around with a belt, and the black student was dressed like he was from the 1800s with a rod of cotton in his hand. From what I could see, everyone was laughing. I was shocked. To add insult to injury, these two won the prize for the high students. Which was 5 dollars. I was upset. This was not funny to me. I thought this was unacceptable. Then it's Black History Month on top of that. I felt alone in this. I felt like I was the only one not funding this funny. Am I crazy???",

I\u2019m looking teach history/politics as most schools in my area do not have specific politics programmes. I know social sciences are popular teaching positions (compared to others) so this could be something important.\n\nIn my years at university (UK), I have not been very good at learning (this is a question about the knowledge, please don\u2019t say \u2018if you want to be a teacher you need to be dedicated\u2019, i know that). I really couldn\u2019t tell you much I\u2019ve learned studying my degree.\n\nI do have decent knowledge just from being interested in the subject.\n\nI\u2019m aware that a lot of teachers (I know in the UK, may be different elsewhere) have specific teaching degrees so don\u2019t even study their course that they teach. \n\nStill, I worry about the importance of \u2018knowledge\u2019 in the job finding process. I have a few questions therefore.\n\n1. How important really is it? If I learn what I need for the course + more, will I miss out on things?\n\n2. How important is \u2018knowledge\u2019 in the hiring process? I\u2019m obviously aware this\u2019ll change on schools and areas, but on average, so interviews centre around questions of knowledge? Do I need to appear knowledgable?\n\nThere are other questions that\u2019d follow from that, but those are my main worries.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Apparently, the younger students(not sure which grades) at their student council meeting mentioned that they would like an art club. I do have concerns about this. 4th grade has lunch with kindergarten and I do not feel comfortable having an art club for kindergarten. 5th grade has lunch with 1st grade and the same feelings as kindergarten. I would offer it to 2nd or 3rd grade but my lunch period does not match up with their lunch so I wouldn't be able to. Do you think I am in the wrong for not wanting to offer art club to kindergarten and 1st grade?

I think this is extremely important to consider and I encourage teachers to impress upon their students the importance of diversity and tolerance. However, I\u2019m a firm believer that racism of any kind is unacceptable. I hear these negative statements toward white peoples in general, as if their a monolith.

This particular child takes getting an answer wrong *way* too seriously. I'm talking if I say \"That's a good thought, but not quite the answer\" or if they guess a note or rhythm wrong, they will get huffy and pouty, or (on a particularly bad day) will start crying either out loud or just sit there waterfalling. Lately, they've also been pouting and whining \"it's not fair!\" when someone else answers a question right or talking over other kids when they try to answer. I've told them that's not appropriate quite a few times now.\n\nThere is no IEP/504 or anything for them according to the records, and the homeroom teacher says this happens with her, too. What would you do?",

Like, they still have not even acknowledged that they recognize me. Am I being petty, or is this a sign of what to expect? \n\nThe reason I\u2019m even interested in this job is that it would be a new subject that I enjoy much more than the prior one I interviewed for, and the kids are begging me to stay. I wouldn\u2019t stay here past this year, but I\u2019m super afraid of taking the plunge into being full time again, mainly bc I was burned last year by a school that wasn\u2019t a fit for me and I knew it from the start",

However, many don't have a set MA level; instead, they'll have something like BA+89 or Ma+44.\n\nWhen I graduate, I'll have taken 54 credit hours towards my Master's on top of my BA. I also have some credits from law school, probably around 45, though I dropped out without a degree to pursue teaching.\n\nWould I be looking at a BA+\\[credits\\] category for my pay, or a MA+\\[credits\\]? It seems strange to think I'd get an MA only to be paid based on BA+ credits, but I also understand that it might be that way. If it is BA+\\[credit\\], would my credits from law school/my MA count, or would it have to be credits earned *after* becoming a certificated teacher?\n\nThanks in advance, y'all!",

I\u2019ve decided to leave the profession and pursue opportunities elsewhere. The problem is that I don\u2019t have the best relationship with either my school or TFA, the organization I worked through. This isn\u2019t for any serious reason or violations, but more like I disagree intensely with some pretty unethical decisions that my school and TFA made and I wasn\u2019t very quiet about it.\n\nNow that I am working on my resume, I\u2019m not sure who or what to put for the past 2 years. I don\u2019t plan on using either my school or TFA as references, but I know that prospective employers sometimes call to check for employment. If I put my school, I am worried that they will lie to prospective employers out of spite that I am leaving, or straight-up badmouth me (my school is a dysfunctional environment that heavily plays favorites, and they\u2019ve badmouthed past employees unprovoked to prospective employers, so it is not a reach to worry that they would do this). If I put TFA, I worry that the same will happen, as the staff in my region and I have a very rocky relationship. I know I could put the National number if prospective employers ask, but I worry they will just look up my regional office\u2019s number and call there. No amount of \u201clegally they can\u2019t\u201d makes me feel better here because over the past 2 years, both TFA and my school have shown me that they don\u2019t care about what\u2019s legal/ethical or not. I know employers could match up W-2s but I doubt most would bother to do that if my school or TFA lied and told them I was never employed with them or falsified my employment dates.\n\nWhat would you recommend? And no, I am not planning on staying in education. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever come back, but it\u2019s certainly not in the near future. I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to have a career anywhere else because of my experience here.",

It was more like one student just saying mean things to other and the other didn\u2019t respond. \n\nSo this all began because I had asked student a to collect the work from the day. Student b apparently hadn\u2019t finished. Student a collected the paper anyways. Student b got upset at student a. But then student b started just sort of picking on student a. Saying things like you\u2019re so miserable and you hate the world. Student a is just sitting there silently. I go over to the the two over them. Student b explains again that student a took their paper before they were finished and they are still very agitated. So I said to student a, next time I ask you to help collect papers, don\u2019t talk away the work from students who haven\u2019t finished yet, ok? Student a nods. I say \u201cok\u201d and student a says ok. I return to my desk to transition to our next activity and student b starts to antagonize student a again. Student a has not responded to anything that student b has said at the point. Now I lost my cool and said \u201cstudent a shut it\u201d. Student b replied \u201cyou shut it\u201d. I asked the student  to leave the classroom at that point. They were already packing their belongs. While leaving they made a \u201cbye everyone\u201d comment while smiling. \n\nI emailed admin and parents about this behavior and explained I expected the student to serve a detention. \n\nMom emails back saying student will not be serving detention, student a told her \u201cthe story\u201d and is requesting a meeting now. \n\nI\u2019m freaking out!

Im not sure where to begin, I know I'm going to have to go back to school for a little while, but do I need to do a whole other 4 years or is there a faster track to becoming a teacher? Anything helps, thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, people tell me i can become a substitute teacher if i get a nomination from a principle. How do I go about getting a nomination with no connection to a sitting principle?",

        "body": "I\u2019m presently about 1/3 of my way through an online education program through WGU. I just got clearance to become a sub and will start doing that soon as well. \n\nI came to teaching as a second or third choice\u2014though really, there\u2019s nothing a actively *want* to do, so it\u2019s not so much a matter of choice as it is the best fit for my existing qualifications (I have a couple of otherwise useless history degrees from my undergraduate years). This is not a course I take because I\u2019m passionate about teaching, but because it seems like a good employment option. I haven\u2019t found the actual coursework in my program at all interesting\u2014it\u2019s simply a huge chore I have to chip away at. I\u2019m not looking forward to subbing, because it seems like that carries all the difficult of teaching with none of the stability or consistency, and being a teacher nowadays seems like a nightmare. \n\nI like to think I\u2019m going into the career with open eyes\u2014I don\u2019t expect this to be a transcendent or even particularly enjoyable thing. I never really wanted to be a teacher, but I think I can do the job well-enough to get by until I make the jump to administration (though I definitely have some ethical issues with that career path), or maybe I can tolerate it well-enough to not get burnt out. \n\nBut I have a lot of doubts. It seems like I hear about or see a video of kids being awful to their teachers, and in truth I can\u2019t blame them too much. How many kids are struggling to survive this meat-grinder of a society already, and yet have nothing other than a bleak future to look forward to. How am I supposed to honestly tell a student that school matters when there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll come of age in the midst of a climate change-induced civilizational collapse?\n\nPlus, honestly\u2026the pay seems like shit for the work that goes in. I fully do not intend to do more than the work I\u2019m contracted for, because why the fuck would I? I\u2019m not a volunteer. Quite the opposite: I\u2019m going through a mountain of annoying bullshit to do this job, I am not going to put up with more bullshit after I get it unless and only if I\u2019m getting paid to do so. And that seems like an attitude which wouldn\u2019t be much tolerated. \n\nGranted, maybe I\u2019ll start doing the job and I\u2019ll find I really enjoy it and these issues will fall away. But I doubt it\u2014given the workload-to-pay ratio, it\u2019s hard to see how any job could be rewarding enough to make being paycheck-to-paycheck while being pressured to do even more work by my bosses. And looking at the state of the world and it\u2019s trajectory, I worry I\u2019ll start to experience emotional burnout from dwelling on the circumstances facing these kids. \n\nSo all that to say, does this seem like a viable path for me? \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m in an education program right now, though teaching isn\u2019t a passion for me, but merely a decent employment option. Can I survive present circumstances?",

        "body": "Hey folks!\n\nI recently assigned students to write a paper on Bulgakov's *Heart of a Dog*. This is a 500 level History course on the history of the Soviet Union. I've run into an essay that I know I need to correct, but I'm not completely sure how to word my correction of one aspect of the paper. Here is a short excerpt from the paper:\n\n&gt;Now after giving you a run down of the story i am going to explain some things on how i think  \nMikhail Bulgakov made some imagery for this story. First I think he used Sharik to portray the  \npeople of Russia, and Eastern Europe. \n\nThere are a few things going on in the paper that I do know how to correct. The student is a little too casual, spends too much time giving a synopsis of the book, things like that. I'm having a hard time wording, though, my correction for the student's use of \"I.\" One way I'm considering wording it is to write about how removing those phrases like \"I think\" or \"I believe\" strengthens the argument; it makes those into statements rather than suggestions. \n\nBut I honestly don't know if that fully covers it. These students are going to have to write a major historiographical essay in a few weeks, and I know if I don't address this now, it's going to be ingrained in that larger paper. Anyone have any suggestions of how I can address this? Or am I just being a traditionalist dud?\n\n(oh, and for the record, this is just a rough draft, this won't impact the student's grade at all, it's just to help polish the paper for the final draft next week)",

        "body": "Hi all! I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this post, so please feel free to delete or redirect this elsewhere if not. \n\nI just graduated last May with a double major in Philosophy and Music Composition (cue snarky impractical major jokes) and I\u2019m thinking about going back to school for teaching, but I\u2019m running into some doubts about it given the current teaching climate and my personal interests. \n\nLet me preface this with the fact that I have a genuine interest in working with kids and teaching in general, I just don\u2019t have the experience to know if it would be a good fit. I\u2019m also very introverted, so I\u2019m pretty nervous about teaching  and I know I\u2019ll have to cultivate public speaking skills, but I\u2019m willing to do that. \n\nBasically, if I go into teaching music, I would want to do a masters in music composition to further my own knowledge and cement theory concepts because that\u2019s something I struggle teaching confidently. Ideally, I\u2019d want to teach music at a college level, but the likely outcome would be teaching high school band/choir which is not really something I want to do (I\u2019d rather teach theory/general music). \n\nI\u2019m also interested in creative writing and I frequently write philosophical novels/essays in my free time. I found a neat masters program where half of the courses are teaching courses and half are creative writing. This is appealing to me since I don\u2019t have a background in English, so I could kill two birds with one stone. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t include a student teaching component. There is another program in my state (Wisconsin) that has a free teaching program if you commit to teaching in the state for 3-4 years. The program requires a content exam (Praxis 5038) that has a bunch of questions about distinguishing 20 different types of poetry in addition to other English concepts that I lack confidence in given I don\u2019t have a background in English. \n\nI could obviously learn English online using coursera etc and pass the test. But the thing is, I don\u2019t really read poetry and literature. I enjoy it when I do, but I usually read philosophy/religion/non-fiction essays for fun. This makes me think maybe the interest isn\u2019t really there. \n\nI have also thought about using my philosophy knowledge and becoming a guidance/school counselor and help kids directly. However, from what I\u2019ve researched about it, there is a lot of administrative nonsense and people frequently quit shortly after getting hired. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I don\u2019t want to spend loads of money only to regret it a year later. Am I crazy for thinking I\u2019m qualified to teach anything? Should I consider a different career path entirely? Any and all advice is appreciated!",

It's also not like I'm actively looking to ditch my school, I've only applied to this one position. \n\nI guess I'd also like to ask this subreddit and anyone who has worked with adults or within the prison system for advice. I spent 2 years at a school working with emotionally impaired adults who at times could be violent, but I understand that's not an apples to apples comparison, though I think it is a strength on my resume for this role. \n\nSorry if I'm all over the place, my brain is a scramble. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

        "body": "I teach in a middle school and one of my students invited me to his Bar Mitzvah- both the service and reception. I teach him multiple times a day, including in homeroom/advisory, which is a pretty close knit group of 7 kids. I\u2019m flattered - apparently he specifically asked his parents to invite me. \n\nI am certain I don\u2019t want to attend the reception since many, many students will be there (as entertaining as this would be, lol.) my question is more about the social norms around this- from the parents POV, is this more of a courtesy invite where they don\u2019t actually expect me to attend? Would it appropriate to attend the service? If I \ndon\u2019t attend, how can I politely decline?\n\nThanks for any input- just feeling stuck on how to respond!",

Doing both at the same time is something that is impossible but I am planning on getting all eventually. I was just curious as to which would be the better option for a first year teacher? Obviously what pays more is a thought, but my main concern is which will better my chances at getting hired once I get my single subject credential. I live in CA and will be attending CSUSB if that helps. I appreciate any advice given!",

The other two categories are \"not sure\" and \"intend to return next year\".\n\nApparently our \"not sure\" category is usually highest, but the killer this year is \"actively seeking other employment\".  Apparently they are going to follow up with an in person meeting to discuss issues and what they could do and send out a second form- but from talking with colleagues it's seems pretty clear: #1 is pay #2 is student apathy.\n\nThis a pretty stable middle class school with few behavioral problems, high graduation and college participation rates etc. Etc.

I know there is always a ton of negative here but even after 20 years I still just chuckle and laugh at teens. \n\nIt\u2019s like , it\u2019s Thursday in my second period class and I just saw a kid slip and fall walking between desk. He got up quick and looked to see if anyone else saw him . In that moment I think I was the only one paying attention but his recovery was just flawless. And he was smooth as he continued. \n\nOde the joys of awkward teens . Yeah, that\u2019s it! On today\u2019s episode of awkward teenagers I am reminded of students practicing dance moves on their way to class . A group of kids doing \u201cThe Jerk\u201d and I just laughed and laughed. You younger teachers might not get that reference but the older ones will. It is a personal view of children that no one gets to see but us teachers. \n\nAnd because of that WE are privileged. We get to see a side of children that not even most of their parents get to see. We get to see them interact with their classmates . We get to see the good, the bad and yes sometimes the ugly . But we are really special and think we need to be reminded of that . \n\nSo now I ask you , my comrades in the trenches of public education. What is one awkward thing that you have seen a student do that just made you smile . \n\nAnd I challenge all of you to have a good rest of the day !",

My university offers an option to apply to get your masters in only 1 year by taking some graduate classes senior year.

Should I pursue a master's degree in English, or should I just graduate and get a MAT if I decide to become a teacher?",

My admin supervisor thought this was ridiculous. But I told her that with all due respect each discipline of math has its own vocabulary. And you need to be familiar with the vocabulary in order to understand the material. I told her that my topology course at the University required learning practically a whole new language.\n\nMy admin was impressed when students started asking questions using the proper math vocabulary terms. And we stopped having the lesson interrupted every 30 seconds for someone to ask me what perpendicular meant. It also improved the students' moods as well because it got to the point where they considered the vocabulary section to essentially be free points on the test.",

Some Nebraska districts have moved to a four-day week, in part to attract and retain teachers. \n\n\"It\u2019s a move that thrilled the school\u2019s teachers, burnt out after teaching through a pandemic and brutal fights over public education. It\u2019s a switch that\u2019s worked better than expected for many parents, including those originally worried about a short week.\u00a0\n\nBut the change also raises questions about whether a four-day week is best for students. The research is limited, unclear and sometimes worrisome. One study suggested that students on a four-day week fall behind learning math. Another found that the test scores of four-day students dipped slightly below their five-day counterparts, though a third showed that four-day students actually did better.\"\n\nThank you for all you do!",

        "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a close teacher friend who has been having a rough year. They recently had a child (born the day before the school year started) and returned to classes that had not been following the subplans and who had been dealing with no discipline. During this time, one of their children (not the new born) was diagnosed with a severe illness, and their partner is taking the time off to taking them to regular treatments that can sometime require week long hospital stays.\n\nTo make matters worse, this group of students (ninth grade) are particularly difficult. I've worked with the (some) of the students in question before, and they had aggressive behaviors and executive functioning difficulties before COVID, and a lot of teachers at the building are struggling with getting kids to follow simple rules. My friend has been called horrible names over things as simple as a seating chart and has been struggling this year, and worse still, the district took all of their sick and personal paid leave for their time off for the baby, and so they can't even take a mental health day to recoup.\n\nMy friend has worked hard to build relationships with students and has made some progress, but some things remain difficult. In our district, cell phones are a major problem. School policy is that students should not have them out, but in praxis a lot of the time it is cell phones are fine so long as they are not a distraction. The student in question here had their cell phone out and was distracted/being a distraction, and my friend asked them to put it away. They refused, so friend asked the student to place their phone into a safe place at the front of the class so it would not longer be a distraction but they would know where it was. Student refused and began making a spectacle. Teacher asked to speak with student in the hall, and student refused that, too.\n\nWhen my friend finally got the student in the hall, they said, \"Don't you f---ing dare talk to me like that again,\" and student began to cry. Within minutes, student called their dad, and dad came to the building yelling how the student was terrified of teacher and how student needs to have their phone so that they can contact their coach (I don't know. I've had a lot of parents/students say wild things to justify cell phone use in class).\n\nSince then, friend has gotten support from their building APs. Friend has apologized multiple times, and friend and APs have offered a restorative with the student and their family to try and sort out the issue and find a resolution to the problem. Parents have refused and sent emails and called friend insulting friends professionalism and arguing that their student is too scared to return to the class. When this didn't get the response they wanted, they went outside of the school building and contacted the dean of secondary education for the entire district, who has now contacted the principal and is asking what is going on.\n\nFriend is beyond exhausted and terrified. They feel like the parents are trying to get them fired, and they are panicking for a number of reasons, not least of which is their sick child (who still has months of treatment left) is on their health insurance. I have tried comforting them, and I know that they are truly remorseful. To this piont, I didn't think much would come of it, but now that they have contacted the higher ups, I don't know. I know none of you know the inner workings of the district, but what do you think?",

        "body": "First, I believe taking care of one\u2019s mental health is important. I.e. eating healthy, getting enough sleep, planning enough idle time to recharge, medicating when necessary, therapy, etc.\n\nHowever, as a high school teacher in a wealthy school district, I am finding more and more that students are using the umbrella \u201cit\u2019s bad for my mental health,\u201d for getting out of things that are challenging/hard. I have so many students who regularly miss school, and become paralyzed with fear when the 0s are inputted in the grade book, which then makes them come to school less because they just want to escape the problem instead of facing it head on. Before the pandemic, I hardly ever had student who were chronically absent. Now I have about 8 (out of a caseload of 100.)\n\nI am starting to have empathy fatigue, especially for my kids who miss 2+ days a week and then come in when they feel like it with extravagant excuses and act like deer in the headlight because they\u2019re completely lost and expect me to guide them to the light. I just want to throw my arms in the air because I know they will be missing again tomorrow, then maybe there the next day, then probably gone for two days. It\u2019s vicious cycle. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I am expressing myself properly; English isn\u2019t my native language but I needed a space to put my thoughts in and maybe get some feedback or perspective that I hadn\u2019t thought of. \n\nI\u2019m a millennial, with a host of mental health issues myself. PTSD and anxiety, to be exact. I don\u2019t remember our generation ever being like that but perhaps I\u2019m forgetting? I find this generation to be not tough, persistent or resilient and it\u2019s worrisome. \n\nThank you for reading me and offering your insight.",

We checked off the box that we did our PD. Then we all went our separate ways to continue doing things the way we've always done them. You know the drill. \n\nPart of the new SEL curriculum was a daily, 20-minute long \"morning meeting\" we're supposed to do with our students. There are a lot of different ways to do the meetings, all explained in detail in the books we were given at our PD. They actually seemed really useful. \n\nExcept they all require 20-30 minutes of planning. Per meeting. \n\nI told my boss that, unless they were going to give me an extra planning period to plan these meetings, the meetings weren't going to happen. I simply refuse to do any work outside of contract hours. I'm a veteran teacher with a wealthy spouse and, frankly, the school needs me here way more than I need this job. I'm here because I still enjoy teaching. \n\nMy younger, less experienced coworkers who actually need this job do A LOT of work outside of their contracted hours. That's up to them, but they also seem burned out and unhappy most of the time. Me? I'm just as happy as I can be every morning. I've got my coffee, my lesson plans for things I've taught a dozen times, and my total lack of stress to keep me happy. \n\nYesterday, the boss asked us all how to the meetings were going. Everyone said the \"right\" things, until it was my turn. I told her the truth: you put more on my plate without taking anything off of my already-full plate, so I haven't been doing them, just like I said I wouldn't. \n\nFortunately for me, my coworkers are used to my bluntness.

        "body": "42% of my juniors are failing my English class right now. I am a teacher who truly believes that if a large majority of your kids are failing it is because of something that I am doing, or not doing, as the case may be. \n\nMy kids are failing simply because they have so many missing assignments in the grade book that they refuse to turn in. And let me clarify, we don\u2019t have homework. All the work is done in class and often the students can use each other for help. \n\nA few weeks ago I decided to have a sit down with my classes to try to understand what is going on so I could better help them. They told me very explicitly that every other year of high school has been very easy because their other teachers \u201cheld their hand\u201d through the work and I won\u2019t do that so now it\u2019s hard and they simply refuse to do work if I won\u2019t hold their hand through it. \n\nThey also expressed their frustration with me when students ask me to repeat an entire lesson for them because they were on their phone the whole time or doing work for another class and my response is \u201cI have posted all the materials. You are more than welcome to view them on your own and if you have any questions I will answer them for you\u201d. They told me it shouldn\u2019t matter if they were paying attention or not, I should be ready to reteach to each and every student who asks.\n\nThis past week we read a short story and the students has to annotate the story and answer questions. I had several papers, signs, and moments where I reminded them of this over the course of the week. When they turned in their work and received 0 for literally just putting their name on their story, they quite literally yelled at me, claiming that I \u201cnever told them\u201d even though the whiteboard directly behind me at the time, that had been up for days, said that this was going to be turned in as an annotated copy.\n\nLast night I received an email from a student who didn\u2019t even attempt all the questions from the packet. She didn\u2019t understand why she has an F because she \u201ctried her best\u201d. I politely emailed her back and told her that I cannot grade based on effort. Each question was worth one point. If you didn\u2019t even attempt them all, I can\u2019t say that you did and that you got them all right. \n\nAnother student emailed me and said she thinks my class is the hardest of all time \u201ceven though we aren\u2019t doing much\u201d and doesn\u2019t understand why she has an F. In the same email she said she wanted to speak with me about her grades and wanted to let me know she turned in her missing work to my IS. \n\nI\u2019m at a total loss. They yell at me every day. I have so many resources available to help them but they refuse to accept the help and literally want me to do the work for them. I\u2019ve had several students in the past few days say to me \u201cthis is hard, can you just do it for me?\u201d And then throw a fit when I say no.\n\nPT conferences are coming up. I\u2019m worried the parents are going to blame me.\n\nAnyway, rant over.",

        "body": "After teaching my entire career here, I\u2019d like to get out of the south. I just don\u2019t know what to expect. If it weren\u2019t for other factors, I\u2019d stay forever. My pay is decent, my retirement is great, my insurance is dirt cheap and pretty good, but it\u2019s becoming quite inhospitable for public education. I\u2019d like to leave before it\u2019s too far gone and move to a state with nearby family at least, but I\u2019ve heard bad things about insurance and retirement in other states. How would I find this kind of information out? \n\nSo far I\u2019m considering Colorado and Rhode Island as I\u2019ve got family in both, but it\u2019s hard to tell what insurance and retirement look like in other states. I\u2019m finding it\u2019s also hard to get a clear picture of what the certification process is like for teachers tranferring from states without reciprocity. \n\nAny insight from educators in those states or from teachers who\u2019ve made big jumps like this would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso, which states should I avoid? What other states should I consider?",

And then I leave with all the students so it\u2019s like 15 mins to even exit the student parking lot. And then I\u2019m leaving today and a student rear ends me. Everybody is watching and now I have to fill an incident report out and file a claim and all this BS. The whole time she\u2019s saying stuff like \u201cI tapped you. There\u2019s no damage\u201d and I\u2019m standing there in silence. There is damage by the way. On top of that I just dislike my position here. I\u2019m used as a baby sitter to watch a student who skips class all day. All I do is follow this student around while they chose to skip class or go and I can\u2019t say anything because of past problems with the parents so I\u2019m just a baby sitter while they play video games all day. I\u2019m so sick of this. I\u2019m skilled and educated in ABA therapy, I\u2019m a behavior technician trained to work with kids with intense autism or disabilities and they have me spending 6 hours a day babysitting a kid who can verbalize that they\u2019ve given up on school and nothing will cause them to change. My life feels useless, unmotivating, unproductive. I asked to be transferred elsewhere and let\u2019s hope they do it. This would be my fourth school in the school year because I was getting moved a lot without my consent (which I guess is fine considering I don\u2019t get a say in this). I\u2019m 19 trying to teacher high school students. They don\u2019t take me seriously, respect my authority, or even consider me a teacher because I look like a student. Half the staff thinks I\u2019m a student when I talk to them and make me uncomfortable by asking my age as an opening question. It\u2019s been 2 weeks at this place and I see no hope. I was at a school being bullied daily and I still managed to have fun with the elementary students. I know if I stay here I\u2019ll spend the next 4 months of the school year not being taken seriously, being mistaken for a student, babysitting a future drop out, and opening and closing tabs on my laptop because nobody gives me any directive.

All calls so far have proven substantiated and cases were opened, investigated, and closed. \n\n2. I already teach with a trauma-informed lens due to my population. Is there anything I can do to support my kiddo specifically as I know home is not somewhere he feels safe? \n\n3. How can I take care of myself with this going on?

This student tries to leave the school, or will simply lay down in the middle of the classroom. The AP who is in charge of SPED and is thus my actual boss has given me clear instructions on if he does xyz, then I need to let her know. I have been given a walkie to carry on me as an IA for this specific reason.\n\nThe teacher in the classroom however, is opposed to me calling for help. Admin has stressed to her multiple times that I am simply following instructions, and that as his one-to-one, I have 100% freedom to make subjective calls about when I feel I need help. (For example, if he\u2019s just lying down on the floor, but keeps looking at the door and we are CLOSE to the door to go outside, I am free to decide that one person might not be enough, and I can ask for them to send someone else to stay with us in case he tries to run. Blocking him can easily turn into a two to three person job.)\n\nWell today he did xyz, so I let admin know as was made explicitly clear to by admin. I didn\u2019t ask for permission\u2014 I was told them I don\u2019t have to because she will always say no lol\u2014 and my teacher got so mad that she lectured me in front of the students about how part of being an IA is working as a part of the team, and how I don\u2019t do that. She also made a big show out of praising the other two paras in the room for \u201calways collaborating\u201d and making another pointed comment about me for \u201cmy actions surprising her.\u201d\n\nBoth of the other IAs stood up for me\u2014 they are awesome coworkers and I love them\u2014 but it was just so disrespectful and humiliating. Everyday I work extremely hard and I work together with my coworkers and make sure we are all on the same page. The very least she could have done was ask to speak with me in private and not lecture me in front of the kids.\n\nI told her I will let her know when I\u2019m about to call for help, but that it\u2019s not a choice I have whether to call or not. I have to. The AP is both of our bosses; we have to follow her instructions. I refused to apologize for calling for help today, though.",

He stated that I shouldn\u2019t worry because this was more important. \n\nI had another check up with him about medication about 3 weeks later and let him know that I\u2019d decided to start the FMLA process. \n\nI submitted the paperwork both online and in person to Kaiser and notified my HR that i\u2019d be taking leave because my symptoms had escalated. \n\nI just received a letter that my FMLA request was denied because it cannot be approved for \u201cmental health breaks\u201d. And the practitioner who signed off on it is NOT MY DOCTOR and I have NEVER been treated by them before.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I\u2019m super panicked and frantic and this is not helping my mental health.",

After that he quickly changed the subject and I got up and left shortly after. It really bothered me, but I tried to let it go in that moment. \n\nThen the last hour of the day, my students were some of the same students he had in his class when he made his \u201cjoke\u201d. While working on their projects, they brought it up directly to me and said, \u201cHe was definitely making fun of a student with special needs today and none of us thought it was funny.\u201d Then they asked me if I thought that was okay. I felt like I was in a weird spot and said something like, \u201cWell, I would never make a joke like that and I really wouldn\u2019t like it if any of you did.\u201d I redirected everyone back to learning, but another student brought it up again at the end of class, so obviously it bothered them too. \n\nSo now I\u2019m wondering what to do with this. I don\u2019t really want to get involved, but I felt pulled in once the students directly talked to me about it.\n\nAny thoughts?",

The second she said that all i was thinking about was quitting. How can they treat people like this? I understand I need to make a good impression, but I feel like i cant take care of myself or my health because of this stress and workload. I dont know if I want to leave because maybe i didnt give it a fair chance. I'm looking to see if maybe there are other schools that are better, but to be honest I am really thinking of leaving teaching in general.",

I immediately told him to get out of my personal space and that he was being totally inappropriate.

There was a ton of room and 0 reason for him to be close to me. I stepped away and told him to never put his hands on me again. I sent an email to my principal and asked for a meeting about what happened. He didn't respond. When I saw him today I brought it up and he said he would talk to the student.\n\nMy mom said it wasn't sexual harassment but I feel so uncomfortable. She said what happened wasn't ok and that the kid will get a warning. I don't think that \"a talk\" is enough punishment for this. I knew being a young first year teacher would be awkward at times but I wasn't expecting 12 year old boys to tell each other they want to f me and other grimey things.

Our current lunch is 55 min and it\u2019s sort of enough time for kids to leave campus, get food, come back. We *might* get away with 45 min if we accept tardies after lunch will be severe. \n\nAnyone have a secondary, 4 day schedule with this number of contact hours and no block that actually works? Right now, it\u2019s looking like we\u2019ll have a minimum 8.5-9 hour day from start to dismissal.

He returned this week and the only response anyone has received from admin is to punish teachers who spread his \"personal\" news around the school.

Several of us have pitched in to cover his class and we are all very understanding that he would need a break. We did not expect that break to be so short.\n\nMy main concern - I have a child that goes to this school who has frequently cried after his class due to his angry outbursts. I have co-workers who have witnessed similar outbursts. Who's to say the next time he wont decide to take kids with him? How is it safe to rush right back into teaching after something like that?

        "body": "Couple things on my mind that can be related but not necessarily so bear with me.\n\n1. I've seen quite a few people say teaching is a great job compared to whatever profession they left. What are your thoughts on this, teachers of Reddit? Just genuinely curious to hear different opinions. I know teaching varies a LOT based on state, grade, district, school etc. Perhaps coming from a boring corporate job some people enjoy feeling like they're making a difference. \n\nPersonally I never saw myself in teaching long term (became an ESL teacher ecause I didn't know what else to do with my degree and enjoyed tutoring ESL students - the former obviously a terrible reason but I truly didn't know what I was in for and had a different impression of what being an ESL teacher would be like based on things I read online.\n\n2. I've heard from other teachers to keep the profession in perspective because many teachers just like to complain, and about the smallest things, often things that aren't really issues. I can see what those people meant to some extent, but I think employees in any field complain because people can like to complain in general. But do you think teaching is much worse than the average corporate job (if that exists) in terms of stress and poor working conditions?\n\n3. Another thing I don't see discussed much is non classroom teachers. It is my view that although far from easy, my role as a non classroom ESL teacher who pulls groups out all day is much more manageable than, say, an elementary teacher stuck in the classroom all day with students nonstop. Any non classroom teachers here want to chime in and tell me - do you find it manageable? Are you miserable? Do you feel mistreated? Do you want to leave?\n\nFeel free to answer any of these you want. Lot of questions so whichever. Just things I've been thinking about for a while now.",

That\u2019s probably a harsh way to describe my experience but it just felt like I didn\u2019t contribute much. Being my first day, they weren\u2019t quite sure yet where to put me, so I was scheduled in 5 different classes, PE for period 5-6. First period was alright, I helped a student with his work and what not for the whole class. But for the other classes? I would say it was hard to establish myself in those classes since the teachers never introduced me to the students. I felt like they didn\u2019t know what I was doing in their class, just some guy who was walking around and randomly asking if they needed help with the assignment at hand. During PE, besides the fire drill we had, I literally just sat there while the kids ran, since that\u2019s all that was scheduled that day. Also, I\u2019m not sure if I should be helping the whole class or just the student(s) the teachers said that usually needed the help the most, It just felt so awkward. Tomorrow my schedule is gonna be different since they said some of the classes didn\u2019t really need someone like me for specific periods, but what can I do different to get the most out of my time there?

What I've noticed over the past few years is that (and this is purely my suspicion) the admins at my school love to extol the accomplishments of the student body and the policies they've enforced by using data such as low suspension rates and passing and failing rates, and I suspect it's to help boost our school's reputation.\n\nThe reason why I think this is undeserving is because I believe it is truly not indicative of the effectiveness of our administration and the school climate at large.  The low suspension rates? They don't indicate any improvement in student behavior, they indicate an unwillingness to suspend students even if their policy explicitly outline suspension as consequences for certain behaviors. I've known of people at my school who later got charged with sexual harassment and sexual battery that initially did not have to face any consequences from the school. The passing rates? They're there because schools as a whole feel as if they cannot afford to hold a student back or have them repeat a course, even if they obviously need more time to learn the curriculum.\n\nAnyone else know if this is a phenomenon in their school/district?",

I'm worried that this complaint is going to make them block me as a substitute teacher and I don't know what to do. \n\nCOMPLAINT:\nWhy in the world that you told STUDENT it was just candy. The one was from a candy gram from her mother. Did you even ask and find out who the hell took it!\nI had it with you the way I hear how you treat STUDENT. I will be talking to PRINCIPAL! And if he does not doing anything about I will be seeing the school board!\n\nMY RESPONSE:\nI did not at any point tell STUDENT that it was just candy, and she did not tell me that anyone took it she said that she lost it. I did tell her that she could look for it later as she asked about it when we were doing our writing.\n\nIf she had said someone had taken it I would have asked about it once writing was done. I told her that if we didn't find it we would get a replacement for it, unfortunately due to the business of the end of the day I didn't have time to personally look for the candygram in the classroom.\n\nEMAIL IM SENDING TO PRINCIPAL:\nI received this message from a parent today and wanted to let you know since he is quite angry. I don't want to aggravate the situation, but I do want you to be aware of it for tomorrow since I'm sure he'll call you.The problem he's referring to is STUDENT told me\u00a0that she couldn't find candygram today\u00a0 when I was in the middle of delivering writing instructions, so I told her we'd find it later and that we could probably call the office for a replacement if necessary. Since STUDENT was sick yesterday, I gave her the candygrams along with her Valentine's Day candy in the morning before reading. The only other time I've had them contact me was in October, when a student scribbled on her reading page and she informed me but she didn't know who it was. I moved her to a different table, and her parents and I discussed the problem during parent-teacher conferences since STUDENT gave them a different story. I brought up the concern of STUDENT having too many items on her desk, which were invading other kids' space, and both instances were resolved at parent teacher conferences.\u00a0In January, I contacted them through email and phone due to an incident involving slime. STUDENT had brought in slime from home, which she had colored red with a marker in the classroom. The slime was thrown away since she misplaced the bag in which she had carried it; I still have the email I wrote. Any other contact I've had with her parents has been over missed work or general communication via the Remind app that OG TEACHER added me to.",

        "body": "Back when I was in junior high in the mid 90s, there were no hall sweeps. Instead, there were consistent rules about being late for class. I remember every time there was a late entry, the teacher would document then send notice down to the front office, which would go to the assistant principal. After five tardies, students were called into the principal's office and issued a warning. If it happened a fifth time, students were issued an in-school suspension the following day.  After two in school suspensions, admin scheduled a parent conference to address the issue.  While punctuality was not perfect at the school I attended, there was a level of consistency on how it was addressed.    \n\nNow lateness is left to random chance with hall sweeps.  There are only consequences for lateness whenever an announcement is made for teachers to lock their doors. And the consequence is only a lunch detention, which is not much of a consequence to some considering there's no recess or opportunities to go outside. Students are confined to the cafeteria for the duration of the lunch break and packed in there like a herd of cattle. \n\nThis is just one example that I find of how the system is broke.",

        "body": "I have a slightly forgetful nature which causes me to lose track of time when I\u2019m preoccupied with important marking or other admin work. I have one teaching day where I have no lessons all morning and only 1 lesson in the last period (2-2:40 pm). Until 1:30 pm i was well aware i have that lesson. But around 1:30 pm, an office staff came up to me about an urgent thing that was my responsibility and i promptly started working on that. My mind completely got preoccupied by that thing that when i went back to my desk i immediately started working on fixing that problem. I totally lost track of time( there are no bells in my school after each period, no music nothing).  It was already 2:20 pm when the office finally alerted me about my class. When i went in, it was a chaos and in my moment of shock, I wasn\u2019t able to think of a \u201cprofessional excuse\u201d like \u201c I wasn\u2019t feeling well\u201d or something. I just owned up to the embarrassment and continued with my lesson. Later, i found out that a few students went behind my back to complain to the year head. The thing is, same thing happened to me 5 months ago. Same class, same reason. So some students took this incident very negatively. They started a rumour that I didn\u2019t come to class because I was sleeping. Or watching something. They told the principal these things. I am shocked. I don\u2019t even remember what excuse i gave when it happened last time, but I definitely didn\u2019t say sleeping. I am so hurt that students would spread such rumours to try and hurt my career. Luckily the principal is supportive and he has been very direct and honest but gave me a chance to explain and be heard. He said i need to fix my relationship with the students.So at this point, i am wondering  if I should just carry on without addressing the issue to the class, ( and find ways to ensure this incident doesn\u2019t repeat again), or when I\u2019m more emotionally stable, should i address the rumours and explain my perspective of what happened(give a more professional explanation to them). They are 14-15 year olds. The class is mostly boys, Im not sure if they will understand or believe me. I feel so gutted.",

        "body": "I graduated in early December of 2022 and started working as a Kindergarten teacher mid December. Coming in halfway through the year has had its own set of challenges, but I feel that I\u2019ve been managing well. \n\nI was warned by the TA and long term sub about the behavior of one of the EC students my first day but couldn\u2019t imagine it being as bad as they said. They were right, but I assumed that her behavior was largely in response to me being new and her needing time to get to know me. The newness has worn off and nothing has changed. From the moment she steps into the room until the moment she gets onto the bus she is disruptive and destructive. She wants your attention and does not want to share it with other students. If she does not get her way she screams, wails, destroys my things, throws materials, throws her shoes, goes limp and falls to the floor and attempts to escape the room when she\u2019s having a particularly bad day. There are moments of sweetness sprinkled in here and there, but she is out of control a majority of the time. I was given picture/word cards and several \u201cfirst/then\u201d charts and visual schedules that do not work and getting her to join us at the carpet for morning meeting, etc is impossible. She does have scheduled EC time where she goes to a different classroom but they are unable to get her to work there much of the time from what they tell me. Admin are really good about coming to remove her from the classroom when she becomes destructive or extremely disruptive but if it\u2019s happening every single day, what do you really do?\n\nIt is getting to the point where other students do not want to be around her. They have made comments about wondering if she will be at school today, hoping she will be quiet, etc. and cover their ears or beg me to call someone when she becomes loud. A student tried giving her a birthday invitation when she was in a particularly bad mood and she threw it and yelled no which hurt his feelings. Another day she was being disruptive during ELA small groups and started yelling in another student\u2019s ear trying to get their attention and that student was upset. I\u2019m trying to shut the comments down and explain to the other students after major incidents that she is having a bad day, not in a good mood, expressing an emotion, etc but it\u2019s every single day that she is in a bad mood or doing something off the wall. If she is in the room, she is screaming and making a mess. When she\u2019s absent or in EC I feel like I have to cram in crash course review lessons to catch the other students up on things that were interrupted and I\u2019m so scared that they\u2019re going to fall behind. I\u2019ve told admin this and they agreed it\u2019s not acceptable and have a meeting scheduled. They really have been supportive. My big worry is that she is going to become an outcast in our classroom because of the way she treats other students and disrupts the class. \n\nAny advice on how to manage until everything is sorted out? I\u2019m new so I\u2019m sure there are so many things that I could be doing better, but I sure have tried a lot of things.",

All they do is complain about how these kids are \u201cunable to read\u201d \ud83d\ude44 and how people \u201ccan\u2019t teach\u201d. It\u2019s horrible and toxic and so many of us are scorned by it.

Some of us have spoken to admin about it, but they\u2019ve done nothing. Now our principal will sometimes sit in the faculty room during lunch, and the employee keeps this up, and the principal says NOTHING, which emboldens this individual more. I guess this is just venting at this point but is this typical in all schools? I\u2019m leaving this school next year because I refuse to be in such a negative toxic environment. It\u2019s affected me mentally, as well as a teacher. I\u2019ve never felt more inadequate. I let their words get to me. How do you let it go? Is it worth leaving?

        "body": "Okay y'all I have been lurking on this sub for awhile and I just have to say this.  I have nothing but love for teachers.  You all do not get paid enough for what you have to deal with.  You need to be aware of your rights.  This is what I know.  I was a school resource officer before I worked my way up the chain to Investigator and then Lieutenant of Investigations.  As much as I loved my students, they knew I did not play.  I could be their best friend if they were in need but if they stepped over the line then all bets were off. \n\nI have to tell you, please please for all that is Holy, please file police reports if you are attacked, assaulted or credibly threatened.  A credible threat means if you are truly put in fear.  I am talking about Abby Zwerner level threat.  If a student is threatening to kill you and you believe in your heart that he/she may do it contact the police.  If a student tells you they are going to kick your a$$ and they are looming over you, balling their fists using aggressive posturing that is a credible threat, contact the police. Tell them you want a written report, and you want a copy of the report and the case number for your records.  This part is important.\n\nIf anyone parent or student puts hands on you report it to the police.  Tell them you want to press charges you want a copy of the report and a case number.  \n\nIf you have a student drinking or drugging in school and you see it, confiscate it, take pictures of it before you turn it over to anyone.  Notify the administration and the SRO to remove the student from your class.  Turn the alcohol/drugs over to the SRO.  Advise the SRO that you want the case number and a copy of the report for your records.  If they balk, you are still entitled to the case number and a redacted copy of the report as you are a witness. If you turn over drugs to administration and there is no Law Enforcement involved your administrator in now in possession of narcotics on school grounds. Back in the day we had a school principal with weed in his drawer that he \"confiscated\", oops on him. \n\nThe reason you always want to emphasis that you want the case number a copy of the report is you want that officer to know that you are dead serious.  You want him to know you will be following up on this case and you are documenting the heck out of this interaction.  Your case number should be available right away.  A copy of the report may have to be obtained from records during the next business day or two. You want to do this in a nice way, but you want to do it.  Most cops love teachers. We all want to feel like we are on the same team. Don't make the police feel like you are adversarial or combative just make sure they know you are on the ball. \n\nYou will still have to follow your protocols with your administration, but people take back your power.  Nobody can stop you from exercising your rights.  You have the right as a victim of a crime to report said crime to the law enforcement agency within the jurisdiction that the crime occurred.  We trust you with our most precious possessions (for lack of a better term), Remember though, you are a precious person to someone also.  You need to go home every night intact physically and mentally. \n\nI see so many posts where y'all are just getting sh!t on.  I had to say something. \n\nNow be safe out there.",

I suspected it was a student of mine from the background noise. \n\nI filed a police report in my district. No speedy action was taken, so I filed another in the town in which I live. The investigator contacted my carrier, found what number the private calls were coming from, and tracked down the caller as a student in my school. \n\nWhat followed was about three months of off-and-on investigation, ultimately winding up with the kid, his dad, and me in court with the kid facing juvenile cyber harassment charges. The dad tried to get me to drop the charges by pleading, yelling, begging, and screaming. I didn't. My district tried to get me to drop the charges. I asked what punishment the kid had faced so far. The answer was none, so I paralleled their answer. \n\nThe judge asked me what remediation I thought was appropriate. I simply stated that the child was not trustworthy with a phone, and did not respect personal boundaries. I also explained the stress this put me under, the wakeups and the worry due to my wife being pregnant. \n\nThe final ruling was that the child was placed under a 36 month injunction where they were not allowed to own, possess, or operate a cellular phone, up for review in 12 months. Everyone but me was in outrage, district included, but I really don't give a darn. \n\nKids have been awfully careful about using their phones appropriately in the building since, and as it was a personal conflict and not a work one, everyone involved just seems to be ignoring that it ever happened. It's a win all around, as far as I'm concerned. \n\nFile the damned police report, people. Maybe nothing happens, but maybe something will.",

Placements outside of a regular education class should be rare, but certainly shouldn't be NEVER. School Districts actually rob disabled students of a FAPE (Fair and Appropriate Public Education) by withholding a proper placement.\n\nThe illegal misuse of LRE places unfair expectations on teachers who are not trained to provide disabled students with what they need. Other students in the class are also robbed of FAPE when a regular education teacher must exert a lot of time and effort to provide what s/he isn't trained to give.\n\nMisplaced sped students may become so frustrated by their inability to succeed in a regular education class that they become dangerous.

See: [https://wehavekids.com/education/Inclusion-in-Special-Education-the-Biggest-Lie-Told-to-Parents](https://wehavekids.com/education/Inclusion-in-Special-Education-the-Biggest-Lie-Told-to-Parents)\n\nBy federal law, disabled students must be properly placed so they can access their education.  \nMany need to be with a SPED professional all day i.e. in a Behavior Intervention Class or a class that teaches life skills (See Section [300.39(b)(4)](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/a/300.39)). In far too many school districts, placement options have been dismantled - and that violates the law. Here is what the IDEA states:\n\n&gt;[300.115 Continuum of alternative placements.](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/b/300.115)  \n(a) Each public agency must ensure that a continuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services.  \n(b) The continuum required in paragraph (a) of this section must\u2014  \n(1) Include the alternative placements listed in the definition of special education under \u00a7300.39 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions); and  \n(2) Make provision for supplementary services (such as resource room or itinerant instruction) to be provided in conjunction with regular class placement.  \n(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1820-0030)  \n(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(5))\n\nTeachers, with help from the unions, parents, site administrators, and community members need to file class action lawsuits and get this fixed!",

I'm a 1st year student and curious to know more about whether notetakers like Notion, Obsidian, Logseq or others truly help you in preparing lecture notes, materials, in educating process or not. \n\nI'm successful in school Olympiads and now I want to help pupils prepare for them and share my experience. So, I'm considering choosing a digital notetaker app to use and would like to know more about their drawbacks especially. In order to be ready for some alternative costs, ofc\n\nBy this I mean that I want to get ready for some issues that I can encounter when trying to get used to &lt;this super cool notetaker&gt;\n\nNowadays the market of productivity tools is too overcrowded and it seems to me like all the apps are the same, just look in different ways. \nBut as you know, visual representation is not the key thing in education.\nI've seen many videos in which people say that notetaking in such \"smart\" apps is just fiction and procrastination. You just feel \"smart\". But in fact you just create an information dump.\n\nSo, I decided to start a discussion here. Maybe you have any clues and things to share. Thanks in advance.",

        "body": "I am a HS CS teacher and I believe it is my job to discuss important concepts and do more with those concepts, i.e. I want my students to *truly* understand the fundamentals of CS. I don't care if they know 7 languages or if they make a new projects everyday: **quality over quantity**.\n\nMy department chair (who I have told you about before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10l3nu3/my_department_chair_is_obsessed_with_not_teaching/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zqr31h/thats_what_they_do_in_the_real_world_how_would/)) disagrees. He is continually wanting us to do more *in a different way*: more course offerings, more languages, more extracurriculars, more clubs, more offerings, more - more - more. Constantly change. Never teach the same thing twice. Add more to the curriculum. More, more, more. Every time we get a new marketing e-mail for a STEM event: more, more, more. \n\nThis is also the same guy that says, \"I cannot believe you leave at 3:00 p.m. I cannot believe I have an employee who leaves when school is over.\" My contract is until 3:00 p.m. and I am NOT *his* employee. \n\nLet's be clear: tech changes. I am not supposing that I should be stagnant, *but* I also believe a few things:\n\n1. It is important for *me* to know about the subject before I teach it and, if I have to learn something new, *I* have to have time to learn it. If you tell me to teach cybersecurity (and I know nothing about it), I am sorry but I need time to learn the concepts - at least a year - to make this class good. \n2. We are teaching students to *learn*, and thus we cannot go too fast. Building 10 projects is not better than 5, especially if those 5 projects are really well-done. (NOTE: this is a sliding scale, there is such a thing as too little). \n3. Sometimes, you have to teach a class a few times (in roughly the same way) to find the correct pacing, assignments, etc. You gotta let the class \"breath\" a bit. The best class I ever taught I taught 8 semesters in a row; I tweaked it every semester, and it was AWESOME by the 5th semester or so. \n4. I believe that stretching out TEACHERS too thin ALSO leads to bad educational outcomes. You work me to death, and I cannot have time to make my teaching effective.\n\nThis is a new school for me, but it is a very successful school. I just don't get this psychopathic desire to constantly go, go, go. Doing *more* is not doing \"more.\"",

        "body": "Before I say anything I\u2019d like to preface by saying that I am on the autism spectrum, which plays a roll in why I\u2019m so overwhelmed.\n\nI\u2019m a para, and one of my assignments is an autistic boy. When he\u2019s having a good day, he\u2019s a fantastic student, highly intelligent and always excited to learn new things (as long as it doesn\u2019t contradict with his worldview.) I love spending time with him on those days. \n\nWhen he\u2019s having an okay day, which is most days, he gets stressed out and hits himself, tears down posters, and makes a spectacle of himself in class with over the top verbal and physical stims (loud mumbling, rocking the chair to a dangerous level). \n\nI have ways of working through this. We give regular breaks, he has a non verbal cue to let me know he needs to take a movement break/ go to a safe space. Instead of destroying things, I give him popsicle sticks or scrap paper to redirect that destructive energy. I practice positive mindset, reminding him that while his struggles are not his fault they are his responsibility to find and use coping mechanisms. He has multiple visual and auditoral modifications at his disposal provided by teachers and many tools such as noise cancelling headphones I bought him with my own money (among other things). \n\nThe okay days are hard, but we get through them. I can tell he\u2019s trying. \n\nThen there\u2019s the hard days. Something sets him off, and for the rest of the day he\u2019s incredibly disrespectful, violent, and a flight risk. Despite the fact that on good/okay days he tells me I\u2019m \u201cthe best para\u201d, it all goes out the window. Today he called me stupid and had a meltdown in front of the entire class. I dropped him at guidance because I needed a moment to myself after that.\n\nTo be clear, I know he didn\u2019t mean it. I know he\u2019s in middle school and everything is tough for him especially because of his disability. I know all that. But it still hurts, both because I hate to see him in such distress and also that it\u2019s incredibly emotionally draining for me. I know that it\u2019s my job as the adult to move on- and I will. But right now, I need to cry in this breakroom.\n\nIf anyone has ideas please share them, thank you for listening.",

Previously I worked in IT for over 20 years and for the last 15 years, I've been working in media production and also doing a little IT work. I recently did a little retraining in IT and did a British Computer society exam and a Data Analytics course. I also spent a few months learning Python.\n\nMy original idea was to get back into IT but a feel this is going to be next to impossible with my gap and am finding it difficult to get enthusiastic about it. I've always loved helping others through training/training and have been involved in community media for a long time. I've also done a little teaching at FE and University level (only very little and it was a long time ago, I can't even work out exactly when).\n\nAnd this has brought me here. I feel teaching Computer Science in secondary schools would be a good fit for me and have looked at the O, AS and A level syllabus and most of it seems very familiar. Some of the topics are not really used a lot currently in IT work but I've been at it for long enough that I am familiar with a lot of these. Yes, there are a few gaps but not many.\n\nMy big gap is working with young people, it's something I have no experience of. I don't have kids but have generally got on with others well.\n\nSo time trying to work out the best way to get experience in this area. Maybe volunteering somewhere. Maybe at a school. Has anybody got any ideas/advice? Both in terms of getting experience and knowing what to put on the ' Your suitability to teach a subject or age group ' section of the application. It does say OR 'age group' but figure they want something related to this?\n\nIme actually applying for PGCE currently and I dought I have time to get any experience before I apply (I may be wrong). I figured if I do get accepted I have a few months before September.",

Getting a little overwhelmed on my day off as I enter grades (I know, I know... but I need to).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI teach middle school theatre and I am entering grades for our 1st out of two major test grades this 9 week grading period. We just finished doing a design unit where students worked independently on designs based off a play we read in class and, when they finished with each step, they uploaded them into a \"Virtual Portfolio\" slideshow. Due to health complications on my end and weather issues causing school closures, I had to cut the lesson just a bit shorter than planned and instead of having the students present their portfolio in front of the class, I am grading it on my own time and we are moving forward with our next unit: theatre history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I am entering grades for this past design unit, I am noticing that the **majority** of students have nothing inserted on their slideshows or **very little** to the point that the class averages are tanking. This even includes my classes that normally excel in every project. This is clearly my fault and I am willing to accept that. I didn't explain it well enough or give my students enough time. What I am struggling with is how to proceed with grades. I think it's really unfair to fail some of these kids because I **know** most of them knew what they were doing and may have just struggled to upload a picture or felt rushed. I really have no time to go back and reteach this specific lesson but I know further down the line in our last unit of the school year, class plays, I plan to dedicate more time on designs to help make up this lost learning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Any tips?** Grade the ones who were able to put in the work and present something but give the rest 70s? Mass 100s? Come back in tomorrow and have conferences one on one with students? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my greatest mentors told me during the midst of a severe panic attack my first year that, \"Grades are made up. They are just numbers. They don't matter.\" While I still believe that and try not to worry too much about it, I am struggling to find the best/fair choice for my kids since this unit's results fall on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help!",

        "body": "The Teacher Project, a scam?\n\nThere's a new marketing guru for teachers looking to quit their standard jobs and begin teaching group classes online for lucrative returns. His name is Elliot, founder of The Teacher Project. Once registered in London, now registered in Leeds, he received a 'First Gazette' for presumably never filing any returns. Theteacherproject.io is their website address. The website is full of teacher testimonials claiming to have earned hundreds of thousands teaching online, all under the guidance of wonderful Elliot. He is now so confident in his recognition that he signs his posts with just 'E.'\n\nThe question is: does The Teacher Project actually work? How much does it cost? And how many of the reviews about it are real? I got in contact with 'Denys' from The Teacher Project who quoted me $5,000-$20,000 for a few months of support. I subsequently wrote a review on Trustpilot about my experience, but it was quickly taken down. It seems they quickly flag reviews, deny that a person was involved with them, and get it removed. I was able to prove my involvement to Trustpilot with evidence of communication from The Teacher Project, which meant my review could stay up for a little while, but not before long, the Teacher Project likely had their sway again and had it removed. There is a horror story review that has stuck around on Trustpilot of one person who paid them a large amount up front and tried to get a refund as per the terms and conditions, however, The Teacher Project apparently refused.\n\nThey have a group and a community on Facebook called 'Student Acquisition Secrets.' It's tightly run, and if you step out of line by making a negative comment, you'll be quickly removed. Some seemingly questionable profiles are admins on the page, with a total of 11 admins/moderators seemingly ready to pounce on any comment you make on the page.\n\nElliot himself had old YouTube videos advertising protein shakes. He then had a 'Teacher Fit Project' aimed at keeping teachers fit while in the classroom. It was obviously a flop, given he then jumped on the opportunity of the switch from classroom teaching to online teaching during the pandemic. We don't know much about his personal credentials, whether he is a qualified teacher or not, whether he has even taught in a classroom or online for that matter. What we do know is that he is a salesman and what he's best at is pushy marketing. The biggest irony is that all the tricks of the trade he promises to teach teachers about how to market potential clients, he is using on those exact teachers. Every trick in the book he tells you about, he uses on you. My question is, how many of you are paying \u00a35,000 - \u00a320,000 for a click funnels account and dirty marketing strategies that focus on the anxiety of parents? I'd love to find out",

        "body": "This is unfortunate. I teach freshmen in high school, and I have 7 classes of the same prep (civics &amp; economics). 6 of my classes are great, a few knuckleheads and sometimes some management issues, but nothing out of the ordinary. 1 of my classes, though, is absolute chaos. I have tried every mediation in the book. I've talked to them down-to-earth about the importance of paying attention, not cutting me off, letting me give them instructions, etc. Basic decency so that even if they hate me as a person and hate my class, they can at least get a passing grade and get out of here. But nothing has worked. If you googled what an attention-seeking and emotionally deprived student looked like, it would be this entire class. After 5 months of trying to level with them, trying different strategies to get them engaged... I've given up. I had a whole skit today to start the class that worked fantastic with all of my other classes and they were having a ton of fun with me acting crazy, but this class I literally couldn't even get through it without the kids basically trying to fight each other - I couldn't even get a word out because everyone was talking over each other. I told them I was done, that I wasn't going to waste my energy for something they didn't care about, and I passed out a worksheet and told them the directions were at the top of the page. Now I'm sitting here writing this out. I still look forward to doing this lesson with my other classes, and many students have shown that they really care and enjoy the work I do to make economics fun and engaging, but this one class is getting nothing from me anymore. I have no more energy to give them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosting as humor because this class of kids is a joke. Just a vent post I guess lol.",

I'm simply looking for a place to vent. \n\nAt my school, I am currently teaching two classes that I've never taught before, one of which I do not have the licensure to teach. I'm teaching Spanish for 6th Grade, English 7 (unlicensed), and Spanish I (my cup of tea). I am so burnt out that I feel like I can barely make it through the year. \n\nI've no idea how to properly teach Spanish for 6th grade or English 7, as I've not received proper training for either of these courses; I've mainly taught high school level courses. Sometimes I can teach my 6th and 7th graders for a whole class period, and other times I'm lucky to get 20 to 25 minutes in; these periods are 45 minutes each. At the same time, I am completing my graduate program for counseling, and it's so much work on its own that I feel as if my head is on backwards. \n\nToday I only taught my 6th graders for 15 minutes because the activities went by so fast. I'm just tired. I'm quitting at the end of the year to hopefully find a better school. I'm trying my hardest. I come into work every day with boatloads of anxiety that admin is gonna walk in during unstructured time or that admin will observe and I not have enough content to teach. I'm just tired and this profession is unforgiving. \n\nI've decided, however, that I'm going to stop caring. I'm trying to make it to the end of the year by doing my best. If 15 minutes is my best, then so be it. I'll probably get chastised for saying that, but sometimes it's all I can muster out. I don't have the time to sit at home, constantly working on supplies/lessons. I'm burnt out. I feel depressed and anxious 24/7. I don't want to do this anymore at this school.",

        "body": "Hi all. I hope I'm posting this concern in the right group, if not, please don't hesitate to point me in the right direction. Also disregard any formatting. \n\n***I KNOW THIS IS A CRAP TON, but thank you sweet souls in advance!*** \n\nI am a boy Mom to a 4YO and 5YO. My oldest started Kinder in Aug 2022 at a school in NW Metro Atlanta area. The excitement we shared for the occasion was through the roof- he was all smiles for months before! And I was personally excited, because the school had good academic ratings and a 30/30/30 demographic. \n\nLet me preface with a few things before I share my concerns. \n\nI went to Kindergarten in '98 in San Francisco. I remember singing, planting seeds in the window, recess, art, and so much more. If you guys have ever seen the TV show Out Of the Box, mix that with a little Magic School Bus, and there you have my perspective. Even as I progressed to have different teachers along with their varying temperaments, it was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my red flags:\n\n1. *It's dang near impossible to be involved.* My parents (even though they weren't even together) were very involved at my school. I know times are very different with mass school shootings (aka locked campus and NO visitors), the residual effects of the pandemic (the rampage common sickness is on is **unreal** rn), and the pressure of catch up academic success (I guess??), but geez, I am in the dark here- I drop him off and pick him up, that's it!\n2. *I have no idea what his day to day is like, and where I can help him improve.* Only during the ONE parent teacher conference we get a year, did I get to figure out what kindergarten was actually like these days. Even if I send an email and ask, everything is labeled as a \"task\"- WHAT TASK?! Help me understand! \n3. *It seems like too much work.* I'm glad he's not a kinder with homework, but he does a lot of worksheets in class which is great! But when you tell me that is writing and computer skills could be better, I want to punch you in the face! HE'S 5!!! You tell me he is too anxious and stressed for his age, WHY DO YOU THINK?! He loves his electives and recess, but he gets so stressed out by the amount of work he has to complete. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI write all of this to ask:\n\n1. Teachers, is there a lot of pressure for you to cram knowledge into these little 5 &amp; 6 YO's and little room for play-based/child driven learning?\n2. I know tech is full force now, but is there any hope for less screens and more kid to kid/kid to educator interaction? (There's a smart board and personal laptops that are used daily in my kids class, could it be overkill?)\n3. How can I help my sweet boy to not be so overwhelmed?\n4. I want so badly to support the super sweet teacher and TA in my kids class, but it seems they are on 10 tryna survive in a different direction.. What do I do?",

She fairly regularly gets yelled at by a parent for giving their child a bad grade or reprimanding them when they misbehave. Worse is when they do it during dismissal when she's trying to make sure her students are going home safely. Plus, that's so disrespectful to do in front of students. But what really angers me is that admin just lets it happen.\n\nI'm an engineer, and if a customer has an issue with the quality of work I do, they don't yell at me; they go to the project manager or my supervisor. That's the way it works. The laborers/workers do the work. The managers and supervisor manage and oversee the work. If there is an issue with the work, it's ultimately the responsibility of the manager. If the customer has an issue with the work, they go to management to get it corrected. They don't yell at me, because it's the manager's responsibility to ensure the work gets done well.\n\nMore than a few times, admin has sat in on meetings and allowed the parents to yell awful, hateful things in my wife's face. Sorry, but your kid is bad because you're a shit parent and allow him to act like a fucking hellspawn at home and then cover his ass when he acts like that elsewhere. Last time there was a meeting like this, a 6'+ 250#+ man got so close to my wife while yelling at her that he was spitting on her face. The principal is a large man, too, but he just sat back and let this big dude flip out at a woman less than half his size crying get eyes out. It feels even worse knowing I can do nothing to protect her in these situations.\n\nIs all admin this chicken shit everywhere? What is the point of admin if not to act as the manager of the teachers? I can't tell you how fucking livid it makes me. Are all parents like this everywhere? She works in a very poor location because it makes her feel like she's making a big improvement in the kids' lives. Is it this way everywhere? I hate to think that people I know that are parents might be doing this to teachers. Is it a systemic issue or a cultural one? Both? It honestly feels like the entire education system is fubar.",

He should be able to pay for a bag of candy!\n\nPrincipal-ma\u2019am, how would you feel if the teacher reached into your purse and stole your money?\n\nMom-I\u2019d beat his ass!\n\nPrincipal-exactly my point\n\nConclusion: never made whole, but paid in laughter. Students were never bought anything else, and were perpetually angry at one kid the whole year.",

And the starting pay is awful.\n\n In my area, teachers live in really nice areas of town (my husband and I both teach) and starting pay is 65k and caps out at 123k. I currently make 113k at year 15. We recently got a 6.8 percent raise this year for COL and a 5.7 the year before because we were on a freeze due to the pandemic.   It could be due to higher COL here in California, but average house in my area is about 450k ish.  Combined with my husband, we make about 200k.\n\nFellow teachers on here comment about not being able to make ends meet, and leaving the profession because they can't afford to stay. Kudos to you for being so selfless. You shouldn't have to be. \n\nAnyway, why does it very so much? It can't *just* be due to higher COL.",

But the kid gave me a name or a nickname on day one, and as the teacher, I'm trying to respect the wishes of the kid.  There is basically no guidance from admin on how they want us to deal with this.  I had a trans student COME AT ME hard because we went on a field trip, and their name tag was their birth name.  \"Well, I'm sorry.  But the school has you rostered as this name, and if something happens to you on this field trip and you get lost or get hurt, they need to identify you by the same name the school has you listed under.\"  In the kid's eyes, it was a betrayal.  Made me feel like a jerk.\n* I feel horrible saying this, but it's so loud and clear to me that 75% of these students who change their name and ID themselves as trans are just trying to dissociate themselves from some part of their life they aren't happy with.  Whatever it is: bad parents, body image issues, awful home life, poverty, you name it.  In many cases, I can't help but connect the dots very easily and see that they are just trying to do this so they can role play being a different person whose life isn't as shitty.  Obviously, there are SOME who are genuinely trans, and aren't doing this to be \"different\" or whatever you want to brand it as.  I have a really terrific former student who was going through hormone therapy during their senior years and we had a great report.  We still keep in touch.  So I am not morally or emotionally numb to these kids.\n* There is no rhyme or reason to it.  A boy asked me to call him Lucy from now on.  I nicely asked, \"is there any particular reason why?  Is there anything else you would like for me to know about you?\"  I just got a hard, \"no, just call me Lucy, now.\"  Then, a week later, it was Courtney instead.  So now I need to say \"Courtney.\"  OR maybe I shouldn't, because what if parents aren't down with it and I get in trouble?  \n\nA lot of you are probably thinking \"stop bending over backwards and just use the name on the roll call.\"  Okay fine, but two years ago we had a female student who almost killed herself because none of the teachers in the school would acknowledge that she really preferred to be seen as male and wanted to be called Mark.  I was the only teacher who would actually use the name.  She/he told counselor that the only reason she didn't go through with the suicide is because of me.  I apparently made them feel like there was some hope for being respected.\n\nIt's just a shit show.   Sorry, but it is.  There is no easy way to do this every day.",

I feel completely isolated in this awful purgatory, and I can't keep doing this. \n\nI know it's hard without knowing details, but I'm really just looking for support right now, since I'm not allowed to talk to any friends at work. I miss my students. I have been getting tons of app notifications of messages from parents from the app we use, and I can't even open them or respond. I'm so scared I won't even be able to go back and see them. I never harmed anyone or put anyone in jeopardy. Being vague, what I'm being accused of is miscommunication. I'm not tenured, which complicates things, but I'm not new to teaching, nor is this my first year in this district. I have a history of great evaluations. It seems impossible that nothing I've worked so hard on could matter.\n\nHas anyone been through an investigation and survived in their workplace to tell about it? I could really use some hope right now.",

They came in 5 minutes late and hadn\u2019t even sat down when they began to yell \u201cYou are NOT expelling our son, we\u2019ve already tried every school within an hour from home and this was our last option.\u201d Um, no you haven\u2019t, you just refuse to get him transferred to alternative school. \n\nWe went straight into talking about his extremely violent behavior, and they accused us of \u201cracially profiling\u201d their son because he\u2019s a black latino adoptee from the Dominican Republic. Literally nobody brought race into it except them. \n\nI also brought up how he seems to be coming to school unwashed, and that he alone makes the whole classroom smell bad and that they seem to be sending him to school unwashed. Again, I was told \u201cThat\u2019s racist!\u201d \n\nI told them about how restraint is considered inhumane and how we can\u2019t give him his prescribed sedatives, and I got told \u201cYou need to have better classroom management!\u201d I have no idea why they blamed me when they already said that he acts like this at home too. \n\nLastly, I asked them to explain how I\u2019m meant to do that when no strategy works and they just complain about it, and they cut me off and told me \u201cIf you continue to be so reckless, we ***WILL*** be suing.\u201d They then walked out. We had an hour booked for the meeting, and they came in 5 minutes late and were only there for 10 minutes. \n\nSchool administration backed the parents and told me that I need to do my job better, and that they will be replacing me due to my \u201cinability to manage violence\u201d. Um, no, I was the one who asked both school *and district* administration for help and got ignored by both. I\u2019m also going to be terminated after this semester.",

        "body": "Just to preface this, I\u2019m pretty close in age to my students. I grew up on the internet, too. The aim isn\u2019t to bash this generation or to generalize a grade-level issue to a generational issue. I just feel like the grade that *I* teach doesn\u2019t wanna learn anything. Not even the easiest, most essential pieces of information. They technically don\u2019t *have* to agree to learn the things I\u2019m teaching them, but it feels self-defeatist to not shut these objections down as fast as I can. \n\nI\u2019m a Global Perspectives teacher. None of my material is meant to be memorized. None of my tests are tailored towards memorization. In fact, I always encourage my kids to *understand* and I always tell them to pay attention in class and ask questions so that they wouldn\u2019t have to study at all (my tests are all designed with this in mind). I\u2019m now teaching them Political Philosophy (on a *very* shallow, basic level, such as: what is philosophy? what is government? what is democracy? where did democracy originate? how does politics affect our daily life?). The kids all erupted, mid-instruction, into: \u201cwhy do we have to learn any of this?\u201d, \u201cthis is so stupid!\u201d, \u201cyou know, the teacher we had last year didn\u2019t make us learn any of this..\u201d, \u201cwell, the teacher we had made us memorize a list of each essential vitamin and its function\u201d, \u201cyeah, but it was easier\u201d. \n\nThey kept protesting the topic, refusing to ask any questions but maintaining they don\u2019t understand. Telling me history is useless, etc. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve moved past providing genuine explanations into consequence/sassy response mode. It feels, to me, like it\u2019s deliberate objection because, unlike math/science (which I believe are fully useful and must be learned in school for many reasons), this is day-to-day life common knowledge that *every single one of them* is guaranteed to have to use in a very direct way. \n\nWhat do you say in response to stupid questions like these - when it\u2019s clear the kids aren\u2019t positively reacting to any real, genuine explanations?",

        "title": "Was \"circle a number\" a common disciplinary technique in the early 2000's? Would it be usable today?",
        "body": "When I was in kindergarten and first grade in the mid 2000's, my teachers used this \"circle a number\" strategy for behavior management. Some of the second grade teachers used it as well. I'm not sure if this was commonplace or just a weird thing my school did, so I'll explain it: Every Monday, each student was issued a sheet of paper to keep in their take-home folder. The sheet had each day of the school week on it, each followed by the numbers 1-6 and a cutesy clip art image. Each time a student misbehaved, they would be told to circle a number. If the student did not circle any numbers that day, they would be allowed to color in the image for that day. If the student had to circle 3 numbers or more, a phone call was made to the parents. If all six numbers were circled, it was a referral to the principal's office. Once a week, parents were expected to sign the sheet to acknowledge they had seen it. \n\nIn kindergarten, they kept it simple. One infraction, circle, one number. In first grade, my teacher began assigning point values based on severity of the infraction. For example, shouting out when you weren't called on meant you had to circle one number, but cussing meant you had to circle three numbers. One time, someone was made to circle all six numbers at once because they were caught crawling under a bathroom stall wall to see a classmate undress. \n\nAfter like 2008 or so, this approach was replaced with flip-card charts. But now, with flip cards and clip charts receiving widespread criticism for the public shaming aspect of how they worked, I pose the question: what was wrong with \"circle a number\"? It was so much quieter and less shame-y, since each child's record for the week was in their own possession rather than up on a wall. It was efficient and effective. These classrooms were extremely well-managed, and the number circling system was the primary method used to discourage bad behavior. I think part of the beauty of it is that it could be used to deal with big and small behaviors alike. Because there were six numbers, and therefore seven \"levels\" rather than the three or four layers a flip card or clip chart system has, you could let a mildly disruptive student know that their behavior is not appreciated without them automatically feeling like they're halfway to a detention. For example, I had a bad habit of shouting out answers without raising my hand, but that was my only problem behavior. By making me circle a single number each time I called out, my teachers trained me out of that behavior without making me feel like I was a bad person. \n\nAs a new elementary school teacher a decade and a half later, would it be reasonable of me to try to bring back this method that was used by my old-school first-grade teacher? What problems would I run into? If this method was indeed common in schools around the country at some point, why did it fall out of favor? What should I be aware of if I try to implement this strategy?",
